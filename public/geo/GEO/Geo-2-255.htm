<P align=center>INTRODUCTION</P></B></FONT>
<P>Covering nearly three-quarters of the earth’s surface, marine and coastal 
waters are the earth’s largest and most vital resources, influencing global 
energy cycles and biological processes upon which all life depends. The ocean 
provides food, medicine, natural resources, habitat, and essential ecological 
services, contributing to many valuable commercial, recreational, and cultural 
opportunities. Each resource and service provided by the ocean relies upon high 
marine environmental quality. The complexity and interdependence of these 
resources, cycles, and biological processes are just being realized as answers 
are sought to questions such as: 
<UL>
  <UL>
    <LI>What are the existing conditions of marine environmental quality? 
    <LI>Are marine environmental conditions getting better or worse? 
    <LI>Are coastal and ocean ecosystems healthy? 
    <LI>Can the fish and shellfish be eaten? 
    <LI>Can swimming be permitted? 
    <LI>Is enough being done to manage environmental quality in marine and 
    coastal waters? 
    <LI>Are there alternatives to traditional regulatory approaches that should 
    be considered in managing pressures (e.g., land-based sources of pollution 
    and coastal development) on the marine environment? 
    <LI>How will increases in human population, increases in consumption, and 
    improvements in technology affect the way people use the ocean, and what 
    will be the resulting impacts on marine environmental quality? 
    <LI>Can/should the assimilative capacities of the ocean be seen as the 
    "ultimate sink" for high-risk wastes from human activities? </LI></UL></UL>
<P>This paper will address marine environmental quality using a 
"pressure–state–response" approach. "Pressure" is the demand placed upon the 
marine environment and its resources by users, pollution, and land-based 
activities. "State" describes the current conditions resulting from these 
pressures. "Response" is what is being done to address the pressures. For the 
purposes of this paper, "ocean" will be broadly defined to include estuarine, 
marine and other coastal waters (e.g., the Great 
Lakes).<SMALL><SUP>1</SUP></SMALL></P>

<P align=center>THE VALUE OF MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY</P></B></FONT>
<P>The ocean plays a critical role in energy and nutrient cycling; it supplies 
minerals and other natural resources, energy, and habitat for sustaining living 
resources, and provides a medium for recreation, learning and enlightenment. 
Nearshore ecosystems are supported by the ocean and the interrelationship 
between oceanic and land systems. This interrelationship can affect the profit 
and growth potential of many economic sectors, including natural resource 
harvesting (e.g., minerals and oil), commercial and recreational fishing, real 
estate, manufacturing, tourism, and waste assimilation. For communities and 
businesses around the country, clean water can mean the difference between 
economic decline and a bright, prosperous future. For marine organisms and 
ecosystems, marine environmental quality can mean the difference between life 
and death.</P>
<P>Value can be quantified for some oceanic resources (e.g., oil energy) and 
services (e.g., transportation), while for other resources, values can only be 
approximated. Each year, 64,000 million tons of sand is mined from the ocean for 
construction purposes and for beach renourishment. In the United States, 
offshore crude oil sites generate between $1 and $9 billion annually and 
directly employ 85,000 Americans. These sites account for 15 percent of U.S. oil 
production and 26 percent of natural gas production. While offshore petroleum 
drilling sites are still a viable source of energy, "alternative" 
non-hydrocarbon renewable energy sources such as temperature gradients and tidal 
energy are being explored. These alternative energy sources may depend upon 
marine environmental quality. Approximately 95 percent of all U.S. foreign trade 
is carried by vessels and passes through U.S. ports (MARAD, 1994). In 1992, 897 
million tons of goods equaling $488 billion passed through U.S. ports (DOT, 
1994).<SMALL><SUP>2</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>Food harvested from the ocean generates approximately $38 billion in economic 
activity for the nation annually. The bulk of this revenue is generated by the 
commercial fishing industry which employs nearly 250,000 people and 70,000 
vessels. Recreational fisheries contribute an additional $18 billion annually to 
the U.S. gross national product. The impacts of poor water quality include fish 
kills and shellfish bed closures, contributing to millions of dollars in lost 
fishing revenues. Wetland losses, water diversions, and other construction 
activities have resulted in the loss of spawning and nursery habitat, further 
reducing commercial and recreational fisheries’ profits. (U.S. EPA, 1996). </P>
<P>_____________________</P>
<P><FONT size=1><SUP>1</SUP>This broad definition is required because of the 
extensive use of estuaries, wetlands, and other coastal areas by humans, marine 
organisms, and wildlife dependent upon coastal ecosystems. In addition, 
evaluation of the interconnections between the land, particularly coastal 
watersheds, and the sea is critical to understanding the value of the resources 
and services provided by the ocean, and the potential impacts of land-based 
activities, often far from the ocean, upon ocean waters.</P></FONT>

<P>From coral reefs to kelp forests, marine and coastal areas are as different 
as the life they support is diverse. As a result, these areas attract a 
multitude of tourists and provide a large variety of recreational activities. In 
1993, the recreation and tourism industry was the second largest employer in the 
nation, with annual sales exceeding $380 billion. Healthy coastal ecosystems are 
critical to places like Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, Santa Cruz, 
California, the Florida Keys, and similar coastal communities which enjoy 
revenue from tourists seeking places to swim, fish, boat, hunt, dive, hike, and 
observe wildlife. The importance of good marine environmental quality was 
evident in a recent survey conducted for Conde Nast Traveler magazine, wherein 
25 percent of respondents revealed that they had changed travel plans because of 
environmental problems at their intended vacation destinations.</P>
<P>Along with direct monetary contributions, healthy marine ecosystems provide 
indirect contributions to local economies through their aesthetic, artistic, 
cultural, and spiritual value. For example, a 1991 American Housing Survey found 
that "when all else is equal, the price of a home located within 300 feet of a 
body of water increases by up to 28 percent." (Smith, 1995). Community and 
business leaders understand the potential value of waterfront locations, and 
often use them as a focal point for urban renewal. </P>
<P>Coastal wetlands, mangroves, and tidal flats play essential roles in nutrient 
cycling and providing habitat for wildlife, as well as protecting coastal 
developments from storm surges and filtering sediments and toxins from waters. 
Where development has been permitted in low lying areas close to the waters edge 
or in converted wetlands, infrequent yet intense storms cause billions of 
dollars in damages (e.g., damage costs from Hurricane Andrew in 1993 were $25 
billion). Wetlands, barrier islands, and tidal flats provide a buffer from 
storms and assist in reducing shore erosion. Many municipalities and some 
industries are incorporating wetlands into their wastewater treatment systems to 
remove nutrients, process some chemical and organic wastes, and reduce sediment 
loads prior to discharge into riverine and marine waters. This form of 
pretreatment reduces industry and municipality costs, protects shellfish and 
swimming areas from closures, and reduces the number of fish consumption 
advisories issued. While wetlands help to improve and maintain water quality, 
they also play an important role in sustaining the health and abundance of 
marine species. It is estimated that 77 percent of shellfish and marine 
commercial species (Chambers, 1991) and 75 percent of all U.S. migrating 
waterfowl depend upon these areas during some stage of their life cycle. </P>
<P>Although it is difficult to quantify, an article in <I>Science</I> by 
Costanza et al. (1997), estimates the global value of the ocean and the services 
it provides to be $33 trillion per year. Most of this value lies outside the 
traditional market system (e.g., commercial fisheries), and comes instead from 
services such as waste treatment, nutrient cycling, and regulation of 
disturbances such as floods or storms. Thus, it is important not only 
aesthetically, but economically to take care of the health of the ocean and its 
resources. </P><STRIKE>

<P align=center>PRESSURES ON MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY</P></B></FONT>
<P>Population growth, coastal development, resource demand, climate, relative 
sea-level rise, and natural coastal processes all affect marine environmental 
quality. Yet, nearly all of the threats to habitat and marine environmental 
quality are human induced pressures<FONT face=Symbol>¾</FONT> from physical 
alteration of the environment to pollution impacts from human activities 
conducted either directly in/on marine waters or within the 
watershed.<SMALL><SUP>3</SUP></SMALL> Land based activities impact marine 
environmental quality, which in turn influences other land and water activities. 
Increasing rates of economic growth and urbanization, pollution, and changes to 
ecosystems, can result in user conflicts in the marine environment. </P><B>
<P align=center>Economic Growth </P></B>
<P>Coastal areas are becoming increasingly crowded, with approximately 130 
million people—more than half of the total U.S. population—currently residing 
within 80 miles of the coast. Growing at a faster rate than the nation as a 
whole, U.S. coastal populations are expected to reach 165 million people by the 
year 2015 (NOAA, 1997). Population growth translates into employment 
opportunities, economic prosperity, new industry, improved regional 
infrastructure, enhanced educational opportunities, and increased tax revenues. 
However, as coastal populations grow, so does the stress placed on the 
environment. The features that first attracted people to the coast can be lost 
or diminished if growth is not planned for or addressed during development. Of 
course, one outcome of economic growth is that an economic base is developed 
from which funds can be provided to ameliorate the impacts of growth.</P>
<P>Increasing population generally results in the conversion of open land and 
forest for activities such as commercial development, agriculture, forestry, and 
other activities that provide economic growth. In addition to physically 
altering the habitat, coastal development can reduce permeable surface area, 
thereby increasing the rate of runoff and impacting water quality by 
transporting sediments, toxic chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, pathogens, 
nutrients, and other pollutants to local waterways. Water recharge capacities 
can be reduced as habitat is changed to accommodate urban development. This 
"hardening of the coast" places stress upon the water table and can lead to 
saltwater intrusion and other marine environmental quality issues. </P>
<P>As urbanization and inland activities increase, so do the volumes of 
municipal and industrial waste discharged into local waterways. This can 
potentially impair water quality at the same time that demands for potable 
water, natural resources, energy supplies, wastewater treatment, and 
transportation of goods increase. Whether from runoff or discharges, excess 
nutrients, sediments, pathogens, and toxic chemicals can impair water quality. 
This in turn can result in a degradation or loss of fishing opportunities, 
changes in wildlife populations, a reduction in the value of wetlands and 
estuaries, decreases in wetlands available for water</P>
<P>___________________</P>
<P><FONT size=1><SUP>3</SUP>Examples of activities that can impact marine 
environmental quality include conversion of open land and forests for commercial 
or residential development, agriculture, forestry, construction, marinas, 
commercial fishing, shell-fishing, hydro-modification activities (e.g., dams, 
dredging), and offshore drilling.</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>treatment, and decreased protection from storms. When habitat is lost, 
wildlife suffers from a lack of area to maintain life cycle processes. </P>
<P>The ongoing increase in global economic interdependency is expected to raise 
the value of U.S. imports and exports from $488 billion in 1992 to $1.6 trillion 
in 2010, while the volume increases from 897 million metric tons to 1.5 billion 
metric tons (U.S. DOT, 1994). Associated with this economic growth is an 
increase in potential impacts on marine environmental quality from the 
additional vessels, port activities, personnel, and other associated industries 
required to accommodate the production and transport of these additional goods 
and services. For example, with greater numbers of ships accessing U.S. ports, 
the potential for the introduction of non-indigenous species through ballast 
water exchange has increased proportionally.</P>
<P>Increasing demands for shellfish and commercial fish have spurred competition 
and technology improvements to increase fishing capabilities. According to the 
National Marine Fisheries Service, commercial landings by U.S. fishermen reached 
10.5 billion pounds in 1993. Increased catches in the 1990s, however, reflected 
the increasing harvest of lower-valued species, as traditional commercial stocks 
became overfished in the late 1980s and 1990s (NMFS, 1996). Over-exploitation, 
in concert with impacts from pollution, habitat degradation, habitat 
modifications such as dams, and by-catch waste<SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP>, has 
resulted in a depletion of some edible fish stocks, placing some ecosystems on a 
path toward unsustainability, and leaving some fishing industries on the brink 
of collapse. </P>
<P>The travel and tourism industry is the largest and fastest growing segment of 
the expanding service industry in the United States. About 85 percent of all 
tourism revenues are received in coastal states, but with these revenues come 
increased demands for drinking water, housing, wastewater treatment, and 
recreational activities. As leisure pursuits change, so do the demands on 
waterway uses and water quality. According to the Sports Fishing Institute, 
Americans participated in 166 million days of fishing in 1990, and approximately 
4 million people over the age of 16 participated in shell fishing. The 
recreational boating industry is growing rapidly with 73.4 million boaters 
having spent $10.5 billion on related products and services in 1991. Already 
stressed from pollution, reefs are at risk as increasing numbers of recreational 
divers concentrate at the ever fewer number of reefs still harboring great 
biological diversity. </P>
<P>Demands for energy and natural resources promote offshore exploration 
drilling and mining. These activities can impact marine habitats and water 
quality through physical disturbances, introduction of pollutants, and 
suspension of sediments into the water column.<SMALL><SUP>5</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>Eventually, the benefits derived from unregulated and uncontrolled economic 
growth and urbanization in an area can come full circle and be outweighed by 
losses of economic growth as residents, tourists, businesses, and industry 
choose to move to other areas where an infrastructure exists that can support 
the demands of multiple uses and still provide an aesthetically pleasing 
environment. </P>
<P>__________________<BR><FONT size=1><SUP>4</SUP>By-catch waste is defined here 
as marine life caught during commercial operations which are not the targeted 
species. Often these organisms are discarded.</FONT></P>

<P align=center>Pollution Pressures</B></P>
<P><I>Direct Discharges</I> </P>
<P>Direct discharges are defined here to include releases from vessels, 
discharges of municipal and industrial wastewater via pipelines, and dumping of 
waste materials, such as dredged material, into ocean waters. In the United 
States, there are more than 2,000 sewage treatment plants, municipalities, and 
industrial facilities discharging effluents into estuarine and coastal waters. 
Approximately 2.3 trillion gallons of effluent are discharged into marine waters 
from sewage treatment facilities annually. While most of this sewage meets 
secondary treatment standards prior to disposal, nutrients and pathogens from 
such discharges can contribute to the degradation of local marine 
ecosystems<FONT face=Symbol>¾</FONT> creating "dead 
zones"<SUP><SMALL>6</SMALL></SUP> and forcing the closure of shellfish beds and 
swimming areas. Nutrient loading can be significant causes of degradation to 
coral reefs and other coastal ecosystems. </P>
<P>More than 2.8 billion gallons of industrial waste water per 
day<SUP><SMALL>7</SMALL></SUP> are discharged directly into U.S. ocean waters 
(U.S. EPA, 1994). Many of the chemicals discharged into marine waters can be 
toxic even in minute concentrations, and can compromise the water column, 
contaminate sediments, and concentrate in marine organisms. Leaching from 
hazardous waste sites has been the source of many toxins in marine waters (e.g., 
In New York, PCBs are leaching into the Hudson River in from an abandoned 
industrial plant). Exposure to these chemicals and metals can pose risks of 
acute or chronic<SUP><SMALL>8</SMALL></SUP> toxicity to marine organisms. In 
addition, the risks to predators and humans can be increased if toxins become 
concentrated through the food chain. In some locations, thermal pollution from 
electric generating plants has been shown to stress marine organisms by raising 
the ambient temperature of the water. </P>
<P>During operations, vessels may be responsible for directly discharging oil, 
sewage, garbage, and non-indigenous species into marine waters. Some pollutants 
are from direct discharges (e.g., the emptying of sewage from vessel toilets, or 
ballast water exchange), while others may be a result of leaching (e.g., 
anti-fouling agents or paints).<SUP><SMALL>9</SMALL></SUP> Once discharged, 
pathogens in sewage can impact drinking water intakes (e.g., in the Great 
Lakes), and necessitate the closing of shell fishing and swimming areas; 
discharged nutrients, meanwhile, can increase 
eutrophication<SUP><SMALL>10,11</SMALL></SUP> </P>
<P>_________________________</P>
<P><FONT size=1><SUP>6</SUP>Dead zones are areas within a water body where the

offshore oil and gas effluents.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1><SUP>8</SUP>Acute levels of toxins are defined as lethal, while

physiological or reproductive processes. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1><SUP>9</SUP>According to 1991 customs data, ballast water

<P><FONT size=1><SUP>10</SUP>Eutrophication is the increase in biological 
productivity of an aquatic system as a result of natural or artificial inputs of

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Oil and other chemical contaminants washed or discharged into the ocean may 
be suspended in the water column, ultimately settling in sediments and 
concentrating in marine organisms. Discharged 
garbage<SUP><SMALL>12</SMALL></SUP> adversely affects marine life (due to 
entanglement or ingestion), and can also cause vessel damage through propeller 
entanglement and by disabling engines when sucked into intake valves. The 
potential negative consequences of invasions of non-indigenous species are 
becoming an increasing concern at ports and coastal areas.</P>
<P>In U.S. coastal and ocean waters, dredged material is the primary waste 
transported and directly disposed<SUP><SMALL>13</SMALL></SUP>. The U.S. disposes 
of approximately 300 million cubic yards of dredged material each year from 
inland and coastal waters, only 60 million cubic yards (20 
percent<SUP><SMALL>14</SMALL></SUP>) of which are disposed of in open ocean 
waters. Unregulated and uncontrolled disposal of dredged material can increase 
suspended solids in the water column and smother benthic organisms. If the 
sediments are contaminated, there is a potential for acute or chronic toxicity 
in marine organisms and a risk to human health (U.S. EPA, 1991).</P><I>
<P>Indirect Discharges</P></I>
<P>One to two-thirds of pollutants contributing to the degradation of coastal 
and marine waters are from indirect sources, and include sediments, nutrients, 
pathogens, and toxic compounds. The difficulty in controlling these pollutants 
is the diverse array of sources (which include runoff and seepage from 
agricultural and urban areas, and air deposition onto land and into water) and 
the multiple methods of transport. Nationwide, it has been estimated that 
indirect loadings account for more than half of the suspended solids, nutrients, 
fecal coliform, and metals entering coastal waters annually. Runoff from 
non-urban areas, sewage spills and overflows, urban storm water runoff, and 
combined sewer overflows are often responsible for seafood advisories and 
shellfish bed and beach closings. </P>
<P>Pollutants from agricultural and pasture lands include sediments, 
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and animal wastes which contain bacteria 
and nutrients. Eighty-eight percent of the total suspended solids entering 
marine waters are from agricultural runoff, contributing to water quality 
problems such as light attenuation and the smothering of sensitive ecosystems 
(U.S. EPA, 1995). Excessive nutrients can stimulate the growth of algae and 
other plants and organisms, which in turn deplete the levels of dissolved oxygen 
and harm aquatic life; too many nutrients can also trigger toxic algal blooms. 
Bacteria and pesticides from agricultural and pasture lands can kill aquatic 
life, contaminate seafood, and necessitate the closing of shellfish beds. 
Cleared land has a reduced capacity to absorb water, resulting in increased 
sediment transport, increased flooding, reduced recharging capabilities of local 
aquifers, and increased quantities of toxic chemicals and nutrients transported 
to local waterways.</P>

<P>_________________________</P>
<P><FONT size=1><SUP>11</SUP>The Centers for Disease Control have linked an 
outbreak of illnesses during the summer of 1997 to waterborne pathogens 
originating from vessel discharges of sewage in shell fishing areas in the Gulf 
of Mexico (CDC, 1997).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1><SUP>12</SUP>Garbage includes but is not limited to: glass, 
metal, paper, plastics, and food wastes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1><SUP>13</SUP>While several other nations dump industrial wastes 
and sewage sludge into ocean waters, the U.S. stopped industrial waste dumping 
in 1988 and ended such sewage sludge disposal practices in 1992.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1><SUP>14</SUP>It should be noted that an estimated 5-10 percent 
of all sediments dredged in the United States are not suitable for open water 
ocean disposal (NRC, 1997). Alternative disposal is sought for these sediments. 
</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Many of the pollutants from urban areas are washed to sea through storm 
sewers. The volume and flow rate of runoff from yards and streets into sewers 
increases as more land is developed, thus the volume of pollutants such as oil, 
fertilizers, and litter that is transported to waterways also increases. 
Fourteen percent of estuarine miles in the United States are impacted from oil 
and grease (U.S. EPA, 1994c). Oil and grease together are major contributors to 
estuarine degradation, with 363 million gallons of oil originating from land and 
municipal and industrial wastes. Annually, oily road runoff from a city of 5 
million could contain as much oil as one large tanker spill (Ocean Planet, 
1995). Over two million pounds of cadmium, copper, and zinc are carried to U.S. 
waters from urban areas annually (U.S. EPA, 1984). Nearly 80 percent of marine 
debris comes from land-based sources, either washed directly into waterways or 
arriving through storm sewer and combined sewer overflows (Coe, 1996).</P>
<P>Another source of indirect discharges is atmospheric deposition. The 
scientific community and coastal managers now recognize the importance of 
atmospheric deposition in causing surface water contamination, and have 
developed and refined models describing the processes of atmospheric deposition 
of nitrogen, phosphates, mercury, and other toxic chemicals. As much as 67 
percent<FONT size=1><SUP>15</SUP></FONT> of the total nitrogen load delivered to 
the Tampa Bay, Florida, watershed (TBNEP, 1996), and 80 percent of PCBs in Lake 
Superior (NOAA, 1997), are believed to originate from atmospheric 
deposition.</P><I>
<P>Accidental Releases</P></I>
<P>Because industrialized society depends on petroleum products to maintain its 
accustomed standard of living, large volumes of petroleum are transported each 
day in the coastal and marine environment. These large volumes are moved by 
vessels as cargo and fuel, and through pipelines. Fixed facilities, offshore 
exploration and production platforms, tanker spills, and natural oil seeps 
contribute millions of gallons of oil to the world’s marine waters annually. 
Spills and leaks cause the formation of tar balls, oil slicks, and tar mats, and 
can impact the micro-layer, the benthos, the coast, and marine life.</P><B>
<P align=center>Ecosystem Alteration</P></B>
<P>While often necessary to ensure vessel accessibility to ports or to control 
flooding, hydro-modification projects, such as dams, flood control channels, 
dredging, water diversions, and the development of wetlands, have profound 
impacts on coastal and marine habitats<FONT face=Symbol>¾</FONT> changing the 
natural flow, timing, and volume of freshwater inflow and sediment depositional 
patterns in bays and estuaries. This is of particular concern in estuarine areas 
where changes in water flow can alter the salinity of the ecosystem, increase 
stress on marine organisms, decrease or eliminate protection from storms<FONT 
size=1><SUP>16</SUP></FONT>, and reduce recharge areas. Alteration of flow can 
also impact marine systems by transporting pollutants and resuspending sediments 
and toxic chemicals, thereby increasing the potential for concentration of 
toxins in marine organisms and humans. Activities such as sandmining, drilling, 
and shell fishing can physically disrupt benthic habitats and resuspend toxic 
chemicals and sediments in the water column. </P>

<P>The introduction of non-indigenous species often results in unexpected 
ecological, economic, and social impacts to the coastal and marine environment. 
Predation and competition by non-indigenous species has resulted in the 
eradication of some native populations and the drastic reduction of others, 
thereby altering local food webs. This process is often compounded by the 
exploitation of commercial fish. Overpopulation of some non-indigenous species 
has resulted in the degradation and loss of wetland vegetation and other 
submerged aquatic vegetation as a result of overgrazing (e.g., nutria). 
Additional impacts of non-indigenous species can include (U.S. EPA, 1997):

Practices such as "Growth overfishing",<FONT size=1><SUP>17</SUP></FONT> 
cyanide, or dynamite fishing<FONT size=1><SUP>18</SUP></FONT> involve the taking 
of all marine species without concern for size or species. The result is that 
noncommercial species are killed during the harvesting process of desirable 
species, or that species are harvested before they reach maturity and can 
reproduce. This removal of multiple species can alter the ecosystem. </P><B>
<P align=center>Climate Change</B><FONT size=1><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></P>
<P>Throughout time, climate change has affected coastal and marine environments 
and will continue to do so in the future. However, human activities and 
alterations to the environment have rendered coastal resources more vulnerable 
to the effects of climate change. Such effects include accelerated sea-level 
rise, increased siltation, altered rainfall patterns, and changes in storm 
frequency and intensity. Over the past 100 years, the relative sea level has 
risen by 1 to 2.5 mm/yr. Climate change and a rise in sea level or changes in 
storms patterns could result in increased erosion of shores, changes in coastal 
and marine habitats, increased coastal flooding, changes in salinity of 
estuaries and freshwater aquifers, altered tidal ranges in rivers and bays, 
changes in sediment and nutrient transport, and changes in the pattern of 
chemical and microbiological contamination of coastal areas. Projections based

<P align=center>THE STATE OF MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY</P></B></FONT>
<P>Good environmental quality is essential for sustaining coastal and marine 
ecosystems<FONT size=1><SUP>20</SUP></FONT>, commercial and recreational 
fisheries, and economic growth in coastal communities. It is also an important 
means of providing natural protection against rising sea levels and storm 
damage. The health of coastal and marine ecosystems is affected by water 
quality, and in turn, water quality is dependent upon ecosystem health. If one 
is impaired, the other is threatened. Despite their value and the programs 
designed to protect them, many coastal waters are being degraded at an alarming 
rate. According to the 1994 National Water Quality Inventory, 44 percent of U.S. 
estuarine waters are not supporting their designated uses (e.g., fishable or 
swimmable). Figure 1 shows the major sources of pollution impairing monitored 
estuarine waters in the United States.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>_________________________</P>
<P><FONT size=1><SUP>20</SUP>Marine and coastal areas include a wide variety of 
systems, such as: wetlands, tidal marshes, sea grass beds, kelp forests, 
mangrove swamps, coral reefs and deep-sea vents. They provide refuge, food, and 
nursery areas for shellfish, fish, birds, worms, other wildlife, and a diversity 
of plant and bacterial life. </FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>Water Quality in Marine Ecosystems</P></B>
<P>To understand the current status of water quality in marine environments, it 
is necessary to consider nutrients levels, along with the extent of 
contamination by pathogens, chemicals, oil, and debris/litter.</P><I>
<P>Nutrients</P></I>
<P>Nutrients have an ambiguous position in the assessment of water quality<FONT 
face=Symbol>¾</FONT> they are necessary to support healthy marine ecosystems, 
but in excess, they can lead to severe oxygen depletion. Excess nutrients also 
stimulate the growth of dinoflagellates and nuisance algae, such as blue-greens 
which are often toxic to estuarine and marine animals. This stimulation in 
growth know as blooms, can have such effects as causing fish kills or manatee 
deaths, and in some instances may threaten human health. Since the end of World 
War II, increases in human population density, fertilizer use, animal husbandry, 
and changes in land use, have contributed to increased nutrient inputs from 
runoff that range in magnitude from two- to ten-fold. It has been estimated that 
40 percent of estuarine and coastal waters are not "fishable or swimmable," 
primarily because of nutrients and bacteria from urban and agricultural runoff 
and municipal wastewater discharges (U.S. EPA, 1995a). Recent studies have shown 
air deposition of nitrogen is also a significant contributor to nutrient 
over-enrichment of marine waters. For example, 21 percent of nitrogen loadings 
to the Chesapeake Bay are from air deposition (Valigura, 1996).</P><I>
<P>Pathogen Contamination</P></I>
<P>Viruses, bacteria, and protozoa can cause diseases in plants, humans, and 
other animals. In excess, they contribute to closures of shellfish beds and 
swimming areas, fish kills, and seafood consumption warnings. The good news is 
that "approved" shellfish harvest waters are at an all time high. Of the 25 
million shellfishing acres classified in 1995, about 59 percent are "approved" 
for shellfishing, and restrictions on shellfishing waters are at their lowest 
levels since 1980. There has been a significant decrease in shellfishing acreage 
that has harvest limitations due to pollution from industry, wastewater 
treatment plants, and direct discharges; however, there has been an increase in 
the acreage that is "harvest limited" as a result of boating, marinas, urban 
runoff, and agricultural runoff (NOAA, 1997). Overall, the condition of 
shellfish harvest waters in the United States is improving.</P>
<P>During 1996, there were at least 2,596 individual closings and advisories for 
ocean, bay, and Great Lakes swimming beaches due to bacterial contamination. 
Over 80 percent of the beach closings and advisories in 1996 were based on 
monitoring that detected bacteria levels exceeding beach water quality 
standards<FONT size=1><SUP>21</SUP></FONT>. Decreases in hurricane activity in 
Florida and decreases in the number of heavy storms in California (NRDC, 1997) 
resulted in fewer combined sewer overflow events and reduced the number of beach 
closings in 1996. The number of beach closings due to pathogen contamination 
continues to decrease as a number of metropolitan areas upgrade their sewer 
systems and separate their storm drains and sewer systems.</P>
<P>_________________________</P>
<P><FONT size=1><SUP>21</SUP>For, example, beaches can be closed to swimming 
when there is a risk of catching waterborne diseases from raw sewage 
contamination. </FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><I>Chemical Contamination</I></P>
<P>Since 1940, more than 70,000 synthetic chemicals have been introduced into 
the marine environment, impacting areas such as the Mobile Delta, where 
excessive levels of mercury in finfish resulted in the closing of some fishing 
areas from 1970-72 and again in the early 1990s (U.S. EPA, 1997). Efforts to 
reduce chemical loadings to marine waters have had some success.<B> </B>Away 
from the influence of urban sources, offshore monitoring of toxic chemicals has 
shown a decline in the concentrations of chemicals which have been banned from 
use in the United States (NOAA, 1997). Meanwhile, reported releases of toxic 
chemicals to surface waters of the United States decreased by 4.1 million pounds 
(a decrease of more than 10 percent) from 1994 to 1995 (U.S. EPA, 1997b)<FONT 
size=1><SUP>22</SUP></FONT>. The decrease in toxic chemicals released to surface 
waters is a reflection of real changes in industry practices such as source 
reduction<FONT size=1><SUP>23</SUP></FONT>, installation of pollution control 
equipment, increased recycling and reuse of waste as raw materials, production 
changes, and a reduction in the number of one-time events (e.g., spills).</P>
<P>Over the last decade, chemical contamination of aquatic sediments has been 
recognized as a serious problem in some U.S. coastal waters. In Puget Sound, hot 
spots of toxic chemicals have been shown to alter and reduce the bottom-dwelling 
community, to interfere with cellular and physiological processes, and to cause 
disease in fish. Most hot spots are in areas of high vessel traffic, industrial 
activities, or poor flushing and are often located near urban centers (NOAA, 
1994). Other adverse economic impacts of contaminated sediments include delaying 
or raising the cost of maintenance dredging of navigational waterways due to the 
potential dangers of resuspending toxic chemicals into the water column or the 
need to find disposal sites for the sediments. </P>
<P><I>Oil Contamination</I></P>
<P>In 1996, approximately 4,200 oil spills occurred in coastal areas and in the 
open ocean. Spill sources range from minor marina activities to one-time 
releases from tankers (U.S. DOT), with major tanker spills accounting for only 5 
percent of the volume of oil spills. Fixed facilities and offshore exploration 
and production platforms contribute 15 million gallons of oil pollution to the 
world’s ocean bodies annually. By contrast, 363 million gallons of oil per year 
reaches the ocean in runoff from land and municipal and industrial wastes. In 
fact, the yearly road runoff from a city of 5 million could contain as much oil 
as one large tanker spill (Ocean Planet, 1995). Natural oil seeps discharge 62 
million gallons of oil into marine waters annually. Effects on organisms from 
oil spills can be acute, such as fish kills from initial contact with the toxic 
fractions of petroleum, or subtle, such as chronic effects on reproduction which 
become evident as toxic chemicals concentrate through the food web of an 
ecosystem. Effects on human populations are realized through economic losses, 
such as those associated with the loss of a fishery or tourism. Particularly 
susceptible to injury from releases of oil are exposed shorelines, shallow reef 
environments, estuaries, mangrove forests, and wetlands (U.S. EPA, 1993).</P>

<P><I>Marine Debris/Litter</I></P>
<P>Two hundred and sixty-seven species of marine organisms are known to ingest 
or become entangled in marine debris that causes injury and sometimes death 
(MMC, 1995). Coastal communities can lose millions of annual tourism dollars, 
experience declines in commercial and recreational fish stocks, incur damages to 
vessels, and see declines in property values as a result of marine debris. 
Annually, $1.5 million is spent by coastal communities in New Jersey to remove 
debris from beaches and coastal waters in order to prevent a repetition of the 
1987 and 1988 beach seasons when $2 billion in tourist revenue was lost as a 
result of debris washing ashore. Lost or neglected fishing gear contributes to 
the depletion of commercial fisheries<FONT size=1><SUP>24</SUP></FONT>. And 
while numbers for the United States are unavailable, Japan estimates that in 
1992, the Japanese fishing industry spent $4.1 billion dollars in boat repairs 
resulting from damage caused by marine debris. Sources of marine debris include 
vessels and beachgoers, but recent studies show that 80 percent is likely to be 
from indirect sources such as street litter, improperly sealed waste 
receptacles, landfills, and from combined sewer overflow events. Annex V of 
MARPOL, an international treaty banning the dumping of plastics from ships and 
regulating other garbage discharges, has been in place since 1988 and 
improvements are being made to reduce marine debris from ships.</P>
<P align=center><B>Ecosystem Change</B></P>
<P>U.S. coastal areas, land and water, support an extensive and unique set of 
ecological, commercial, and recreational functions, and provide food, shelter, 
and nursery areas for birds, marine invertebrates, fish, and other wildlife. 
Across the nation, estuaries contain 32,300 square miles of wetlands, 21,900 
square miles of shellfish waters, and 27,000 public recreation sites (Baily, 
1993). Despite their ecological importance, many of these productive areas have 
been modified or lost to support residential, agricultural, industrial, and 
commercial growth. As habitat is lost, wildlife systems are strained for 
sufficient area to maintain life-cycle processes.</P><I>
<P>Habitat Alteration</P></I>
<P>Since the 1700s, the 48 contiguous states have lost nearly half of their 
original wetlands (Watzin and Gosselink, 1992). Twenty-five years ago, wetland 
losses were estimated at 460,000 acres each year. Today, wetland losses are 
estimated to be one-fourth of that rate or less (U.S. EPA, 1997). Nonetheless, 
physical alteration or degradation of habitat continues to occur, with a 
concomitant loss of diversity, as a result of human activities such as 
channelization, drainage for agricultural purposes, development, and 
dredging.</P>
<P>_________________________</P>
<P><FONT size=1><SUP>24</SUP>For example, approximately 31,600 crab pots were 
lost in Bristol Bay, Alaska, between 1990 and 1991; if each trap caught and 
killed one legal-sized crab per year, the annual catch would be 205,400 pounds. 
</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Such a drastic decrease in habitat acreage has had a great impact on marine 
and terrestrial species dependent upon these ecosystems for spawning, nurseries, 
and habitat. During some stage in life, 77 percent of all commercial species and 
80-90 percent of recreational fish and shellfish catches rely upon wetland areas 
(NOAA, 1997). Eighty percent of endangered species depend on habitat within 10 
vertical feet of sea level (NOAA, 1995). Between 80 and 90 percent of U.S. 
shorelines are undergoing net long-term erosion; while some of this erosion is 
due to natural processes, erosion resulting from anthropogenic factors has 
increased over the past century. The development of tidal flats and barrier 
islands has eliminated unique and essential habitats for many plants and animal 
species. </P>
<P>In addition to physical alterations, water quality impairment and habitat 
loss can be caused by excess nutrient loading, sedimentation, and increasing 
levels of pathogens and toxic chemicals. Sediment and nutrient loadings have 
increased turbidity and light attenuation, thereby killing submerged aquatic 
vegetation. Only 10 percent of the seagrass beds that existed several decades 
ago still exist today. In Florida, siltation and nutrient loads have reduced 
mangrove forests by approximately 24 percent and caused severe damage to coral 
reef systems (U.S. EPA, 1997). Alteration of the natural flow can have 
significant effects on water quality, health, and distribution of living 
resources. In the upper Laguna Madre River of the Corpus Christi Bay, changes in 
freshwater flow in 1996 have increased salinities from 10-20 ppt<FONT 
size=1><SUP>25</SUP></FONT> to 55 ppt (U.S. EPA, 1997). The change in salinity 
has decreased the total productivity of the oyster population and reduced the 
economic value of the estuary.</P>
<P>While the dredging of harbors and shipping channels can cause temporary 
increases in turbidity, dredging is necessary for port accessibility and 
navigational safety. Recent years have seen a change in emphasis on dredged 
material management. Ports lose revenue when vessels change their destination to 
ports with shipping channels deep enough to accommodate them. It is now 
recognized that dredged material can also be a resource for enhancing or 
building wetland habitats, or for other uses such as beach renourishment. 
Beneficial use of dredged material usually costs more than traditional open 
water disposal methods. However, with the passage of more consistent 
cost-sharing formulas between federal and local project sponsors (e.g., the 
Water Resources Development Act of 1996), it is expected that the amounts of 
dredged material used to build habitats will continue to increase.</P>
<P>On a more global scale, climate change as manifested by rises in sea level 
and changes in storm patterns and storm surges has led to environmental impacts 
that include: 
<UL>
  <UL>
    <LI>increased erosion 
    <LI>increased salinity of estuaries and freshwater aquifers 
    <LI>altered tidal ranges in rivers and bays 
    <LI>increased coastal flooding 
    <LI>changed sediment and nutrient transport patterns 
    <LI>changed patterns of chemical and microbiological contamination in 
    coastal areas </LI></UL></UL>
<P>_________________________</P>
<P><FONT size=1><SUP>25</SUP>ppt equals parts per thousand</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Secondary impacts from climate change that may occur include inundation of 
waste disposal sites and landfills from storm surges which result in the 
reintroduction of toxic materials and increased siltation into the marine 
environment. Areas in the U.S. Gulf Coast are experiencing a relative sea level 
rise of 10 mm/year. In Oahu, Hawaii, one quarter of the beaches have been lost 
or significantly degraded over the past 50 years due a multiple of marine 
environmental pressures, but heightened storm surges could greatly increase this 
rate.</P><I>
<P>Adverse Biological Effects<FONT size=1><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></P></I>
<P>The over-exploitation of living resources, the physical destruction of 
habitats, pollution, changes in climate, and the introduction of non-indigenous 
species, all combine to threaten the biodiversity, integrity, and productivity 
of marine and coastal ecosystems. Over-exploitation of species reduces their 
ability to maintain population levels<FONT size=1><SUP>27</SUP></FONT>. 
Overfishing can create an imbalance in ecosystems by depleting food resources 
for predators while allowing populations on which depleted species would have 
otherwise fed to grow. This can be the beginning of an ecologically 
unsustainable trend.</P>
<P>The introduction of exotic or non-indigenous species into an area, whether 
intentionally or accidentally, often results in unexpected ecological, economic, 
and social impacts to the marine and estuarine environment. These occurrences 
often pose threats to local species that are relied upon for food, medicine, 
recreation, and raw materials (Norse, 1993). Through predation and competition, 
introduced species have contributed to the eradication of some native 
populations and drastically reduced others, fundamentally altering food webs. In 
San Francisco Bay, California, Amur River clams have become so abundant that 
they can filter a significant volume of the Bay in less than a day, removing the 
bacteria, phytoplankton, and zooplankton that are necessary to support the local 
food web. Zebra mussels are responsible for millions of dollars in water supply 
maintenance costs in the Great Lakes. In the Delaware Estuary, <I>Haplosporidium 
nelsoni</I>, a parasitic protozoan, has caused catastrophic die-offs of American 
Oyster. It is thought that this organism<I> </I>was transferred from Asia or the 
U.S. West Coast via ballast water (Ford, 1996). The Asian clam, <I>Corbicula 
fluminea</I>, dominates the bivalve community in the area between Trenton, New 
Jersey and the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. In some areas, this exotic clam 
makes up 94 percent of the total benthic invertebrate biomass (Maiden, 
1993).</P>

<P><FONT size=1><SUP>27</SUP>For example, total finfish landings have declined 
from 2.9 million pounds in 1980 to less than 340,000 pounds in 1989, mainly as a 
result of “growth overfishing”, a reduction in the size of fish caught and stock 
depletion. Of the species found in the Indian River Lagoon basin in Florida, 75 
are listed as rare, threatened, endangered, or species of special concern by 
state or federal agencies. In Corpus Christi, Texas, the numbers of shrimp 
landed in the bay fishery have increased more than 300 percent since 1972. In 
1996, 1,871 bay shrimp boat license holders plus 1,806 bait shrimp license 
holders trawled in these bays harvesting an already depleted stock. </FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Habitat may be directly affected by development and water control efforts, 
but degradation due to toxic chemicals, excessive nutrients, sediments, and oil 
can be just as devastating. Habitat alterations from these causes range from 
physical smothering to changes in population structure associated with exposure 
to chemicals in the water and sediments. Pollutants such as pesticides and 
herbicides threaten living resources by contaminating the food chain and 
eliminating food sources. Contaminants in runoff and toxic releases can alter 
aquatic habitat, harm animal health, reduce reproductive potential, cause 
disease, and contribute to behavioral abnormalities that may affect organism 
survival and suitability for human consumption.<FONT 
size=1><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></P>
<P>There is evidence that suggests certain pollutants or changes in marine water 
quality (e.g., increased nutrients) may initiate, maintain, and extend the 
duration of toxic algal blooms and further impact human health and marine 
organisms. These blooms are thought to be initiated from offshore patches of 
organisms that are transported to coastal waters where high nutrient levels 
sustain the bloom conditions. For example, in 1996, 149 manatees died in Tampa 
Bay, Florida, after exposure to a toxic red tide that remained behind the 
barrier islands well into the spring migrating season. In another case, high 
phosphorus levels are thought to be one of the conditions required to trigger 
<I>Pfiesteria</I> blooms such as occurred in North Carolina and Maryland, and 
resulted in associated fish kills and human health concerns (U.S. EPA, 
1997).</P>

<P align=center>RESPONSES TO CHANGES IN MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL 
QUALITY</P></B></FONT>
<P>Three decades ago, water quality was at an all time low, with rivers catching 
on fire, harbor areas of cities being deserted, great numbers of shellfish beds 
closing on an annual basis, and people getting sick from swimming. In the 1970s, 
Congress passed several laws to address environmental problems, of which the 
most significant for the protection of marine waters were the Clean Water Act, 
the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act, and the Coastal Zone 
Management Act. However, laws alone do not suffice to cleanup, prevent, improve, 
or protect water quality<FONT face=Symbol>¾</FONT> people must become actively 
involved. Among the many means to protect marine and coastal waters are: 
<UL>
  <UL>
    <LI>the traditional regulatory approach which includes the permitting of 
    specific discharges; 
    <LI>risk prioritization and pollution prevention; and 
    <LI>the watershed approach which looks at the sources of pollutants as well 
    as the system to which they are discharged. </LI></UL></UL>
<P>Whether voluntary or as a result of regulations, actions taken to improve 
water quality should be based upon sound science, consider the needs of all 
users of marine environments, and take into account technological and economic 
constraints.</P>
<P>_________________________</P>
<P><FONT size=1><SUP>28</SUP>In Sarasota Bay, Florida, the alteration and 
degradation of juvenile fish habitats, seagrass beds, and wetlands are the most 
likely causes of the 50 percent decline in commercial landings of sea trout over 
the past 30 years. Over the past 50 years, bird populations in the Tampa Bay 
area have dramatically decreased due to water quality impacts on their natural 
habitats (U. S. EPA, 1997).</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While some shellfish beds remain closed today, and some beaches continue to 
be closed for days at a time, overall water quality in the United States has 
vastly improved. While much progress has been made, the environmental problems 
facing ocean and coastal waters present formidable challenges to the scientific 
and technical communities, who seek to understand natural processes and 
delineate causes and effects, as well as to policy makers, regulators, and 
stakeholders, who prioritize actions and allocate limited funds.</P><B>
<P align=center>Legislative and Regulatory Framework</B><FONT 
size=1><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></P>
<P>In 1972, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act was passed. Subsequently 
reauthorized and renamed the Clean Water Act (CWA), this Act has set the basic 
structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into waters of the United 
States. The goal of the CWA is the "restoration and maintenance of the chemical, 
physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters" (33 U.S.C. §1251(a)). 
Various sections of the CWA provide for monitoring programs, ecosystem 
management, non-point source pollution control, best management practices of 
pollutants, wetlands protection, and water quality controls. Under the CWA, it 
is illegal to discharge pollutants into U.S. waters without a permit. The U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for establishing water 
quality standards for specific pollutants and developing discharges guidelines 
for specific industries. </P>
<P>The CWA has been successful in reducing pollutant loadings from point 
sources, but a bigger challenge remains in reducing pollutant loadings from 
non-point sources. Under the CWA, states are directed to develop management 
plans for non-point sources of pollution, including the identification of best 
management practices and programs to implement such practices on a watershed 
basis to the maximum extent practicable. The Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization 
Amendments of 1990 (CZARA) and the CWA also established the National Estuary 
Program (NEP), which is a consensus-based approach designed to identifying key 
problems in a particular estuary, develop a plan to address those problems, and 
implement the actions in the plan. There are 28 NEPs nationwide, 17 of which are 
now implementing approved plans. </P>
<P>There are many users of the coastal areas of the United States. The Coastal 
Zone Management Act was enacted to provide for the management of the nation’s 
coastlines by balancing economic development with environmental preservation to 
"preserve, protect, develop, and where possible, to restore or enhance the 
resources of the Nation’s coastal zone" (16 U.S.C. §1452). This Act also 
provides for a state-administered regulatory program for non-point sources in 
coastal areas. The River and Harbor Act of 1899 states that all modifications to 
navigable waters require a permit. The issuance of these permits are subject to 
public review and the National Environmental Policy Act. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>_________________________</P>
<P><FONT size=1><SUP>29</SUP>This section on Legislation/Regulation is only a 
sample of the most important legislation and regulations related to coastal and 
marine waters. </FONT></P>
<P>The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act establishes national 
marine sanctuaries for areas that have special significance based on their 
"conservation, recreational, ecological, historic, research, educational or 
aesthetic qualities" and controls dumping of wastes into ocean waters. The 
objectives of the national marine sanctuaries program are as follows: 
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>(1) establish sanctuaries in areas of special national significance 
(currently there are 12 national marine sanctuaries) </P>
<P>(2) develop and implement coordinated protection and management plans for

<P>(3) facilitate public and private uses insofar as they are compatible with 
resource protection </P>
<P>(4) support scientific research and public education in the

<P>As noted previously, dumping of sewage sludge and industrial wastes ceased in 
the United States as a result of the Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1998. Disposal of 
dredged material into ocean waters is controlled by regulations under the Marine 
Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act.</P>
<P>As a result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, Congress passed the Oil 
Pollution Act of 1990. This legislation established more stringent requirements 
for preparedness and prevention of spills which were implemented by regulations 
promulgated by the U.S. Coast Guard. Industry and government were mandated to 
take measures to reduce the risk of a catastrophic release of oil into the 
marine environment. As a result of this law, transporters of oil and production 
facilities were required to develop and implement response plans, participate in 
preparedness drills, and maintain safe shipping and handling practices.</P>
<P>The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 
commonly known as the MARPOL Treaty, also governs the release of oil, hazardous 
substances, and garbage into the marine environment. Annex I of MARPOL deals 
with the prevention of pollution by oil and places requirements on new oil 
tankers; Annex II governs noxious liquids carried in bulk; Annex III governs 
packaged harmful substances; Annex IV deals with the control of sewage and other 
"grey water"; and Annex V deals with garbage (which includes plastics, metal, 
glass, galley wastes and other materials.)</P>
<P>The conservation of fish and wildlife is addressed through a number of 
statutes such as the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, which requires the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service to review 
any action that may affect any body of water and to make recommendations for the 
conservation of fish and wildlife. This includes (1) determining standards for 
water quality, (2) studying methods for abating and preventing pollution and 
recovering useful products, and (3) collecting and distributing data on the 
results of investigations. The Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 mandates the 
protection of essential fish habitat, including protection from impacts other 
than fishing. Living marine resource management within the 200 nautical mile 
Exclusive Economic Zone is the responsibility of the federal government and 
regional Fishery Management Councils. Nearshore fisheries within approximately 3 
nautical miles from U.S. shores are managed by coastal states and interstate 
marine fisheries commissions. This joint and overlapping jurisdiction requires 
that these councils work together to protect fisheries resources. The Endangered 
Species Act directs federal agencies to ensure that actions they authorize or 
conduct are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or 
threatened species, or result in the destruction or modification of their 
critical habitat. The Marine Mammal Protection Act<B> </B>provides a framework 
to develop specific protection programs for marine mammals.<FONT 
size=1><SUP>30</SUP></FONT> </P>
<P>In a 1997 report, the National Research Council (NRC, 1997) concluded that 
"Developing a coherent framework to guide the nation’s activities in the ocean 
and coastal regions is especially important in this time of growing national 
interest in the ocean, which includes heightened awareness of the need to 
protect it, along with recognition of new opportunities to utilize marine 
resources." The National Research Council recommended that the general elements 
of the framework include: (1) creation of a National Marine Council which would 
improve coordination and facilitate issue resolution among federal agencies, (2) 
creation of regional marine councils to coordinate and facilitate issue 
resolution at the local level, (3) enhancement of individual federal 
ocean/coastal programs, and (4) adoption of management tools by the regional 
councils and agencies, such as zoning and the creation of refuges, and user 
charges.</P><B>
<P align=center>Technical Basis for Action and Research Programs</P></B>
<P>Many of the ocean’s functions and processes remain a mystery. For example, 
studies indicate that the relative contribution of pollutant loading from 
atmospheric deposition can be significant. Yet to date, knowledge of atmospheric 
and surface water processes is not sufficient to determine, with confidence, the 
overall magnitude and impact of atmospheric deposition on marine waters. 
Knowledge gaps such as this have been recognized by researchers, planners, and 
governments. U.S. government funding of coastal research was $673<FONT 
size=1><SUP>31</SUP></FONT> million between 1991 and 1993 (NSTC, 1995). In 1997, 
the Department of Defense, the Navy, and the Army spent nearly $90 million in 
basic ocean research and more than $50 million in applied ocean research.<FONT 
size=1><SUP>32</SUP></FONT> State and local governments, universities, private 
nonprofit institutions, and industrial organizations also spend additional 
large, but unquantified, sums annually for activities that support coastal 
science. </P>
<P>The Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation 
and Liability Act, and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 created an upsurge in 
research and development efforts. These efforts have focused on prevention, 
clean up, and spill mitigation. Recent emphasis has centered around the human 
health aspects of marine </P>

<P>environmental quality and on incremental improvements in technology, resource 
reduction, equipment, pollution prevention, and response strategies. Such 
improvements have resulted in new regulations and the transfer of 
"state-of-the-art" technologies to other industries and sectors. Agencies have 
incorporated risk analysis and cost benefit analysis into their programs to 
ensure they are "reality based." To offset decreases in funding, agencies are 
exploring more opportunities to increase cooperation and share resources while 
conducting research and developing management strategies in marine environmental 
quality. The challenge for the future will be to continue this trend and to find 
new ways for government, industry, academia and nonprofit organizations to 
cooperate. </P>
<P>Government agencies and private industry in partnership have developed new 
technologies to prevent and reduce the impacts of pollution. For example, there 
have been significant improvements in ensuring that ports and waterways are safe 
for navigation, and evolving technologies allow the collection and dissemination 
of near-real time tide and current data to aid ship captains and port 
authorities. Traditional methods to contain, recover, and remove oil from the 
marine environment have been refined and new ones developed to reduce the 
environmental impacts of oil spills. Technologies in the oil and gas industry 
have contributed to vast reductions in the volume of oil and hydrocarbons 
released into the marine environment from these activities. Traditionally, 
research has focused on understanding the transport, fate, and effects of 
various types of oil once a release has occurred. The prevention of spills is 
now a priority, and risk prioritization studies assist government and industry 
in the identification of potential sources and situations in which accidental 
releases might occur. This research may have a high return as many spills have 
similar causes. Once identified, procedures can be modified, technologies 
improved, and situations avoided to prevent, reduce, or to contain spills. </P>
<P>To advance coastal environmental science and to manage coastal resources more 
efficiently, an integrated understanding of fundamental physical, chemical, and 
biological processes based on site-specific comparative studies of coastal 
ecosystems is needed. These studies need to account for the impacts of 
activities in associated watersheds and airsheds. Increased communication 
between researchers and policy makers, greater coordination among the many 
organizations responsible for governance and management, and the application of 
knowledge derived from one study to other systems, are necessary to address 
marine environmental quality issues, determine the effectiveness of such 
measures, and assess the value of healthy marine waters.</P><B>
<P align=center>Assessment of the Success of Environmental Protection Programs 
and Early Warning Systems: Research and Monitoring</P></B>
<P>In the past, research has been stimulated by catastrophes such as fish kills 
in North Carolina and the Chesapeake Bay caused by <I>Pfieisteria piscicida</I> 
or toxic algal blooms. Research into the cause and prevention of such events has 
yielded technological advances and furthered understanding of the ocean. For 
example, after the Exxon Valdez spill, government agencies, industry, and the 
scientific community worked to develop methods to prevent oil spills and to 
effectively clean up spills if they do occur. After the 1987 and 1988 beach 
closings in New York and New Jersey, governments, industry and environmental 
organizations worked together to implement better management measures to reduce 
the volume of plastics and other wastes washing ashore and posing risks to human 
health. This reactive approach has serious implications in terms of monetary and 
environmental costs<FONT size=1><SUP>33</SUP></FONT>. Standardized and regular 
monitoring of waterbodies, the use of water quality indicators, and 
implementation of best management practices can assist in the prevention of 
major environmental crises. </P>
<P>Because the ocean is "downstream" of all homes, communities, rivers, and 
watersheds, the health of the ocean is inextricably linked to the health of all 
the watersheds in the country. Identifying and reducing sources of pollution in 
"upstream" watersheds will help to maintain and improve the health of the ocean. 
In October of 1996, the Index of Watershed Indicators was released (U.S. EPA, 
1996b). This Index is designed to give the American people ready access to 
information about water pollution in their communities, and is a compilation of 
information that presents the first national picture of watershed health in the 
United States. </P>
<P>The Index is comprised of fifteen indicators or "data layers" that focus on 
either the condition of aquatic resources (e.g., fish and wildlife consumption 
advisories, source water quality for drinking water systems), or the 
vulnerability of the resources to certain activities (e.g., urban runoff 
potential, hydrologic modification, or wetlands loss). The Index will continue 
to be modified, incorporating new information such as atmospheric deposition of 
pollutants and eutrophication conditions within coastal waters.</P>
<P>A fundamental improvement in the way the United States monitors its 
environment is required if it is to meet the challenges of the next several 
decades. Current monitoring programs do not provide integrated data across 
multiple natural resources at the various temporal and spatial scales needed to 
develop policies based on scientific understanding of ecosystem processes. Many 
monitoring programs identify violations of permits or provide status reports. 
These networks and programs can be better integrated to provide information 
needed for effective ecosystem management across a range of spatial scales 
(CENR, 1996). For example, the EPA is developing new testing methods, monitoring 
protocols, and water quality standards for pathogens in swimming areas to bring 
some uniformity to water quality warnings nationwide. Models for storm events 
are being developed which will enable local communities to predict when pathogen 
levels are likely to exceed water quality standards due to storm sewer 
overflows, thus enabling local officials to close beaches in order to prevent 
potential illness. Proactive monitoring efforts can identify potential problem 
areas, allowing steps to be taken prior to the collapse of an ecosystem or an 
event such as a fishkill.</P><B>
<P align=center>Management Approaches and the Long Term Challenges</P></B>
<P>Significant progress has been made since the early 1970s when many of the 
environmental laws protecting the ocean were passed (e.g., 1997 marked the 25th 
anniversary of the passage of the</P>
<P>_________________________</P>
<P><FONT size=1><SUP>31</SUP>Coastal communities in New Jersey, for example, 
spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to remove marine debris from their 
beaches. </FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Clean Water Act, which is responsible for among other things for preventing 
millions of gallons of raw sewage from entering the ocean). While much progress 
has been made in protecting the ocean, there is still much that is unknown about 
marine and coastal waters and much that needs to be done to protect them and 
their resources. The challenges may be daunting, but they are manageable. 
Stakeholders working together in partnerships is a key component to furthering 
progress in protecting, restoring, and maintaining the health and productivity 
of ocean resources. The major environmental problems that need continued 
emphasis through protection and enhancement programs include: 
<UL>
  <UL>
    <LI>nutrient over-enrichment: eutrophication 
    <LI>pathogen contamination 
    <LI>toxic chemicals 
    <LI>alteration of freshwater inflow 
    <LI>loss and degradation of habitat 
    <LI>declines in fish and wildlife populations 
    <LI>introduction of invasive species 
    <LI>accidental spills </LI></UL></UL>
<P>The control of non-point sources is key to making further progress in 
protection of ocean waters and habitat. Point source management measures have 
greatly improved water quality. Industrial and municipal discharges of waste 
water are controlled under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System 
and this effort has greatly reduced pollutants such as toxic chemicals and 
untreated sewage entering marine and coastal waters. However, major challenges 
remain in identifying causes and effects of various pollutant sources, 
addressing non-point sources of pollution, reducing wetlands loss, and finding 
and implementing solutions to these and the other coastal environmental problems 
listed above. Several examples of current actions to address these problems are 
provided below.</P><I>
<P>Nutrient Over-enrichment</P></I>
<P>Increased incidences in 1997 of fish kills and fish with lesions in 
tributaries to the Chesapeake Bay highlighted the growing national concern over 
the impacts of outbreaks of toxic <I>Pfiesteria piscicida</I> and other harmful 
algal blooms. Marine biotoxins and harmful algae represent a significant and 
expanding threat to human health, marine mammals, and fisheries resources 
throughout the United States. In addition to causing threats to public health 
and wildlife, the death and decay of algal blooms can lead to oxygen depletion 
in the water, resulting in widespread mortalities of fish, shellfish, and 
invertebrates. When oxygen depletion reaches a sufficiently high level, a "dead 
zone", or area where marine life cannot survive, may occur (as in the 7,000 
square mile Gulf of Mexico dead zone).</P>
<P>There is strong evidence connecting harmful algal blooms with nutrient 
pollution<FONT face=Symbol>¾</FONT> excessive nitrogen and phosphorus<FONT 
face=Symbol>¾</FONT> in the water. In general, three significant sources of 
nutrient pollution have been identified: discharges from septic systems or 
sewage treatment plants, agricultural runoff from fertilizer or animal wastes, 
and air deposition of nitrogen, primarily from electric utility power plants and 
vehicle emissions. EPA, NOAA, and other federal agencies are working together 
with states to better understand and control harmful algal blooms in general and 
<I>Pfiesteria</I> in particular. This includes investigating what steps can be 
taken to reduce nutrient pollution in an effort to help prevent these outbreaks 
and their effects. </P><I>
<P>Dredged Material Management</P></I>
<P>The disposal of dredged material can be a controversial issue but one that 
must be addressed in order to keep the nation’s ports and harbors open. An 
action plan developed by an interagency federal working group is now being 
implemented for improving the management of dredged materials to ensure timely 
and effective dredging while meeting environmental goals (U.S. DOT, 1994). 
Eighteen specific recommendations were identified for improving dredged material 
management, one of which was to improve federal agency coordination. 
Consequently, a National Dredging Team of federal agencies was created and 
Regional Dredging Teams are being established to assist in coordination and 
issue resolution. In addition, Local Planning Groups are being established which 
will include all interested stakeholders. These groups will be charged with 
developing long term dredged material management plans. Finally, a national 
dredging policy has been established which recognizes the need for timely and 
effective dredging to assure the viability of the nation’s ports and that the 
aquatic environment is a critical asset which must be protected. </P><I>
<P>Marine Debris Monitoring Program</P></I>
<P>An interagency workgroup has developed a statistically-based national marine 
debris monitoring protocol to quantify amounts of debris and identify debris 
sources. Implementation of this protocol began in 1996, under the National 
Marine Debris Monitoring Program<FONT size=1><SUP>34</SUP></FONT>. The use of a 
statistical protocol will assist in enabling the assessment and implementation 
of practices to prevent marine debris from entering marine waters. This in turn 
will protect marine life from harm due to marine debris and reduce costs borne 
by coastal communities to remove marine debris from beaches. To date, this 
monitoring program has been established on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, and 
similar programs have been adopted in other areas of the world such as Ireland, 
countries in the Caribbean, and Canada.</P>
<P><I>Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure and Health (BEACH) 
Program</I></P>
<P>Swimming at the nation’s coastal areas continues to be one of Americans’ top 
vacation choices, yet many beaches are not adequately monitored for disease 
causing microorganisms. As a result, vacationers may be putting themselves at 
risk of illness, which can ruin more than just their day at the beach. Through 
the new BEACH Program, initiated in May 1997, EPA in partnership with state, 
tribal, and local governments will be working to keep beachgoers better informed 
of the water quality conditions where they are swimming. The adoption of updated 
water quality standards for bacteria, faster testing methods, enhanced 
monitoring and notification programs, and new scientific research into disease 
causing microorganisms under the BEACH Program, will help all beachgoers enjoy a 
happier, healthier time at the ocean.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><I>Uniform National Discharge Standards</I></P>
<P>EPA has established a successful partnership with the Department of Defense 
to develop Uniform National Discharge Standards (UNDS) for liquid discharges 
from armed forces vessels. Currently, vessel discharges are regulated throughout 
the country under varying state water quality standards. These regulations will 
enable the Armed Forces to design vessels to one protective uniform standard, 
instead of attempting to conform to a diverse array of state standards.</P>
<P>The aim of the UNDS regulations is three-fold. First, uniform, 
environmentally protective standards will enhance the operational flexibility of 
Armed Forces vessels. Second, the Navy has an extensive research and development 
program aimed at constructing environmentally sound ships for the 21st century; 
the UNDS development process will stimulate innovative pollution prevention and 
control technologies that will help the Navy achieve this goal. Third, most of 
the innovative pollution prevention technologies developed for UNDS eventually 
will be available for transfer to the private sector.</P><I>
<P>Accidental Spills</P></I>
<P>The Oil Pollution Act has led to increased post-spill monitoring and improved 
restoration of affected habitats by facilitating recovery of damages by state 
and federal natural resource trustees from responsible parties. Money recovered 
by trustee agencies goes directly to restoring the resource or acquiring the 
equivalent resource on behalf of the public. Improvements in understanding how 
and when to use physical, chemical, and biological treatment of oil have helped 
to minimize the environmental damage caused by large oil spills. Improved 
response time to spills and technological advances have increased the 
opportunities for response agencies to limit the injury to marine resources. 
However, despite significantly reducing the risk, large-scale releases of oil 
continue to occur in the marine environment. There is an ongoing need to support 
research and development, and the training required to respond to oil spills. In 
addition, there is a recognized need to share technical capabilities with the 
international community through government-to-government requests or through the 
International Maritime Organization. </P><I>
<P>Research Programs</P></I>
<P>While progress is being made in identifying solutions to the complex problems 
confronting coastal waters, further progress requires fundamental research in a 
number of areas to address threats such as widespread over-enrichment and 
habitat degradation. Presently, research programs concerned with coastal systems 
and related processes/effects/controls are not guided by a comprehensive 
national framework. Such a framework could assess scientific priorities related 
to the most serious problems and optimize cooperation and coordination among 
federal agencies, states, local communities, and the academic community. 
Although significant advances in the scientific understanding of coastal 
ecosystems has been generated from numerous studies of specific systems during 
the past four decades (e.g., estuarine or wetland systems), the resulting 
knowledge of the fundamental properties and processes of this nation’s coastal 
ecosystems suffers from the fragmented regional nature of these studies. For 
example, the impacts of air deposition on coastal and marine waters and the 
range of transport are just beginning to be understood.</P><I>
<P>Watershed Protection and Community-Based Protection Programs</P></I>
<P>The problems facing the nation’s coastal waters are scientifically complex, 
are caused by a diverse array of factors, and involve resource intensive 
solutions. These coastal problems cannot be addressed through traditional 
regulatory approaches, although this is still a component of the solution. The 
new paradigm for the 1990s and into the next century is the need to look 
holistically at the entire resource being protected and to examine all of the 
contributing factors to the resource’s degradation within the watershed. Linked 
with this comprehensive examination is the critical need to involve the 
community in the identification of problems and the implementation of solutions. 
One example of this approach is the National Estuary Program which is designed 
to protect and restore estuaries of national significance through partnerships 
between government agencies, industry, and the people who depend on those 
resources for their livelihood and quality of life. The National Estuary Program 
was established because conventional pollution control programs were not 
adequate for dealing with complex estuary problems. Management conferences of 
the established NEPs do not have regulatory authority, therefore, 
recommendations reached by consensus must be implemented by existing authorities 
at the federal, state, and local levels or through voluntary action. Another 
example is the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary Program, which developed a 
comprehensive water quality protection plan through a comprehensive examination 
of the entire "watershed, " and through communication with a broad array of 
stakeholders.</P><I>
<P>Clean Water Action Plan</P></I>
<P>Federal agencies are coordinating efforts to develop a comprehensive Clean 
Water Action Plan that builds on the successes of the Clean Water Act over the 
past 25 years and addresses three major goals: (1) enhanced protection from 
public health threats posed by water pollution; (2) more effective control of 
polluted runoff; and (3) promotion of water quality protection on a watershed 
basis (White House, 1997). </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><FONT size=4><B>
<P align=center>CONCLUSION</P></B></FONT>
<P>The ocean plays a critical role in sustaining the life of this planet. Every 
activity, whether natural or anthropogenic, has far reaching impacts on the 
world at large. For example, excessive emissions of greenhouse gases may 
contribute to an increase the sea level, and cause potential flooding or an 
increase in storm frequency; this flooding can reduce wetland acreage and 
increase sediment and nutrient flows into the Gulf of Mexico, causing adverse 
impacts on water quality and reducing habitat for commercial fisheries. This in 
turn drives up the cost of fish at local markets nationwide. </P>
<P>The environment and the economic health of marine and coastal waters are 
linked at the individual, community, state, regional, national and international 
levels. The interdependence of the economy and the environment are widely 
recognized. The United States has moved beyond viewing health, safety, and 
pollution control as additional costs of doing business to an understanding of 
broader stewardship, recognizing that economic and social prosperity would be 
useless if the coastal and marine environments are compromised or destroyed in 
the process of development (President’s Council on Sustainable Development, 
1996).</P>
<P>Much about the ocean, its processes, and the interrelationship between land 
and sea is unknown. Many harvested marine resources depend upon a healthy marine 
environment to exist. Continued research is needed so that sound management 
decisions can be made when conflicts among users of ocean resources arise. 
Although much progress has been made over the past 30 years to enhance marine 
environmental quality and ocean resources, much work remains. The challenge is 
to maintain and continue to improve marine water quality as more people move to 
the coasts and the pressures of urbanization increase. Through education, 
partnerships, technological advances, research, and personal responsibility, 
marine environmental quality should continue to improve, sustaining resources 
for generations to come.

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The legal regime covering this topic is based on a collection of important 
federal statutory authorities. The following is a brief description of some of 
those authorities relating to marine environmental quality. The list is 
selective and is designed to illustrate some major marine environmental quality 
acts. The list is not meant to be comprehensive.</P><U><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships</B></U>, as amended, (APPS), 33 U.S.C. §§ 
1901 <U>et</U> <U>seq</U>.</P>
<P>a. Oil and Noxious Liquid Substances.</P>
<P>The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships as originally enacted implemented 
Protocols I and II, and Annexes I and II, of the International Convention for 
the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 
1978 (MARPOL). Annex I of MARPOL establishes requirements to prevent the 
discharge of oil except in accordance with specific conditions. Annex II 
provisions cover the discharge of noxious liquid substances. (Annex III, which 
addresses the prevention of pollution by harmful substances carried by sea in 
packaged forms, or in freight containers, portable tanks or road and rail 
wagons, is implemented by the hazardous material transportation acts, 49 U.S.C. 
§§ 5101 <U>et</U> <U>seq</U>., <U>inter</U> <U>alia</U>.)</P>
<P>APPS applies to all U.S. flag ships anywhere in the world and to all foreign 
flag vessels operating in the navigable waters of the United States or while at 
a port or terminal under the jurisdiction of the United States. The oil and 
noxious liquid substances provisions apply only to seagoing ships. The 
regulations implementing Annex I and Annex II of MARPOL limit discharges of oil 
and noxious substances, establish report requirements for discharges, and 
establish specific requirements for monitoring equipment and record keeping 
aboard vessels. In particular, the regulations require that vessels covered by 
APPS and MARPOL keep Oil Record Books in which all discharges, disposal and 
transfers of oil are kept.</P>
<P>b. Garbage and Plastics.</P>
<P>APPS was amended by the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 
1987, which implemented the provisions of Annex V of MARPOL relating to garbage 
and plastics. Annex V of MARPOL and the regulations implementing it apply to all 
vessels, whether seagoing or not, regardless of flag on the navigable waters of 
the United States and in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. It 
applies to U.S. flag vessels wherever they are located.</P>
<P>Under the regulations implementing APPS, the discharge of plastics, including 
synthetic ropes, fishing nets, plastic bags and biodegradable plastics, into the 
water is prohibited. Discharge of floating dunnage, lining and packing materials 
is prohibited in the navigable waters and in areas offshore less than 25 
nautical miles from the nearest land. Food waste or paper, rags, glass, metal, 
bottles, crockery and similar refuse cannot be discharges in the navigable 
waters or in waters offshore inside 12 nautical miles from the nearest land. 
Finally, food waste, paper, rags, glass, and similar refuse cannot be discharged 
in the navigable waters or in waters offshore inside three nautical miles from 
the nearest land. There are some exceptions for emergencies. Under APPS, the 
definition of ship includes fixed or floating platforms. There are separate 
garbage discharge provisions applicable to these units. For these platforms, and 
for any ship within 500 meters of these platforms, disposal of all types of 
garbage is prohibited. Additionally, all manned, oceangoing U.S. flag vessels of 
12.2 meters or more in length engaged in commerce, and all manned fixed or 
floating platforms subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, are 
required to keep records of garbage discharges and disposals.</P><U><B>
<P>Clean Air Act</B></U>, as amended, (CAA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 7401 <U>et</U> 
<U>seq</U>.</P>
<P>The CAA is divided into six principal subchapters. Subchapter I addresses air 
pollution from stationary sources and requirements for states to develop plans 
to meet health-based standards. (Also, subchapters IV-A, V and VI deal with 
specific stationary source programs.) Part A of subchapter I contains the basic 
provisions to control air pollution from stationary sources. Based on statutory 
criteria, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to list criteria 
pollutants and for each such pollutant establish primary and secondary national 
ambient air quality standards (NAAQSs). Each state (or EPA, if the state 
declines) must submit to EPA a state implementation plan with individual 
emission limitations and procedures to ensure timely attainment of the NAAQSs 
for each air quality region within the state. </P>
<P>Part A also includes, among other things, key specialized stationary source 
programs. For example, EPA must adopt emission standards for categories of 
hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) in accordance with a specified schedule. (HAPs 
are listed in the statute.) Section 112(m) of the CAA directs EPA, in 
cooperation with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to assess 
the extent of atmospheric deposition of HAPs (and, in the discretion of EPA, 
other air pollutants) to the Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay, Lake Champlain and 
coastal waters (defined, for purposes of the subsection, as estuaries under the 
National Estuary Program and National Estuarine Research Reserves). The 
assessment program is to, among other things, establish a monitoring network, 
investigate sources and deposition rates, evaluate any adverse effects to public 
health or the environment, and assess the contribution of such deposition to 
violations of water quality standards established pursuant to the Clean Water 
Act. EPA is to submit biennial reports to Congress on the matter and issue a 
determination as to whether the other provisions of section 112 are adequate to 
prevent serious adverse effects to public health and serious or widespread 
environmental effects associated with HAP deposition. If EPA determines that the 
authorities of section 112 are not adequate, the agency is directed to 
promulgate such further emission standards or control measures under section 112 
as may be necessary and appropriate.</P>
<P>Part B of Subchapter I is repealed; Part C addresses the "prevention of 
significant deterioration" program, designed to limit the deterioration of air 
quality in regions with air cleaner than the minimum federal air quality 
standards. Part D addresses plan requirements for non-attainment areas.</P>
<P>Subchapter II addresses emission standards for moving sources. </P>
<P>Subchapter III addresses administration and enforcement. Amendments to 
Subchapter III made in 1990 require EPA, following consultation with the 
Department of the Interior and the U.S. Coast Guard, to establish regulatory 
requirements to control air pollution from Outer Continental Shelf sources 
(except in the Gulf of Mexico, over which the Department of the Interior has 
jurisdiction).</P>
<P>Subchapter IV-A addresses acid deposition. This subchapter was added in 1990 
to reduce emissions of pollutants, primarily sulfur dioxide and nitrogen 
dioxide, leading to the formation of acid precipitation. </P>
<P>Subchapter V addresses permits, requiring each state to submit to EPA for 
approval a permit program covering basically every pollution source subject to 
the CAA. If a state fails to submit and implement an approved program, EPA is to 
step in. </P>
<P>Subchapter VI addresses stratospheric ozone depletion.</P>
<P>The CAA also establishes a great waters program, which looks specifically at 
the impacts of air deposition of nutrients and toxics in coastal waters.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><U><B>
<P>Clean Vessel Act of 1992</B></U>, subtitle F, §§ 5601 to 5608, of Title V of 
Pub. L. 102-587, amending 16 U.S.C. §§ 777c and 777g and enacting 33 U.S.C. 
§1322 note</P>
<P>The purpose of the Clean Vessel Act is to provide funds to states for the 
construction, renovation, operation and maintenance of pumpout stations and 
waste reception facilities. The Act requires the Department of the Interior 
(DOI) to issue guidance on what constitutes adequate and reasonably available 
pumpout facilities and waste reception facilities. In order to receive a grant, 
coastal states are to conduct a survey to determine the number and location of 
such stations and facilities and the number of recreational vessels in its 
coastal waters with toilets and develop and submit to the DOI for approval a 
plan for any construction or renovation necessary to provide adequate and 
reasonably available stations and facilities. Funding authorization for such 
grants expired in FY 1997.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><U><B>
<P>Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982</B></U>, as amended, (CBRA), 16 U.S.C. 
§§ 3501 <U>et</U> <U>seq.</P></U>
<P>The purpose of CBRA is to promote more appropriate use and conservation of 
coastal barriers along the Atlantic, Gulf, and Great Lakes coastlines. "Coastal 
barriers" are defined as bay barriers, barrier islands, and other geological 
features composed of sediment that protect landward aquatic habitats from direct 
wind and waves. They provide essential habitats for wildlife and marine life, 
natural storm buffer zones, and areas of scientific, recreational, historic, and 
archeological significance. CBRA seeks to minimize the loss of human life, 
wasteful federal expenditures on shoreline development, and damage to wildlife, 
marine life, and other natural resources by restricting future Federal financial 
assistance, establishing the coastal barrier resources system (CBRS), and 
considering the means of achieving long-term conservation of barrier resources. 
</P><U><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972</B></U>, as amended, (CZMA), 16 U.S.C. §§ 
1451 <U>et</U> <U>seq</U>.</P>
<P>The CZMA strives to preserve and protect coastal zone resources. Through the 
CZMA, states are encouraged to develop coastal zone management programs (CZMPs) 
that allow economic growth that is compatible with the protection of natural 
resources, the reduction of coastal hazards, the improvement of water quality, 
and sensible coastal development. The CZMA provides financial and technical 
incentives for coastal states to manage their coastal zones consistent with CZMA 
standards and goals. </P>
<P>State coastal zones include the coastal waters and adjacent shorelands that 
extend inland to the extent necessary to control activities that have a direct, 
significant impact on coastal waters. For federal approval, a CZMP must: 1) 
identify the coastal zone boundaries; 2) define the permissible land and water 
uses within the coastal zone that have a direct and significant impact and 
identify the state's legal authority to regulate these uses; 3) inventory and 
designate areas of particular concern; 4) provide a planning process for energy 
facilities; 5) establish a planning process to control and decrease shoreline 
erosion; and 6) facilitate effective coordination and consultation between 
regional, state, and local agencies. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration grants the requisite federal approvals for CZMPs and oversees 
subsequent implementation of the programs.</P>
<P>A state with a federally approved CZMP is eligible for financial assistance 
and gains a legal mechanism to control Federal permits and activities that 
affect the state's coastal zone. Federal agency activities that affect any land 
or water use or natural resource of the coastal zone must be consistent to the 
maximum extent practicable with the enforceable policies of the state CZMP. 
Federally licensed or permitted activities that affect any land or water use or 
natural resource of the coastal zone must be consistent with the enforceable 
policies of the CZMP. The Secretary, however, can override a state's 
determination of inconsistency if the Secretary finds that the federally 
licensed or permitted activity is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA or 
is otherwise necessary in the interest of national security.</P>
<P>The CZMA establishes the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERR). 
States may seek Federal approval and designation of certain areas as NERRs if 
the areas qualify as biogeographic and typological representations of estuarine 
ecosystems and are suitable for long-term research and conservation. Once an 
area is designated as a NERR, federal financial assistance is available for 
acquisition of property and management, research, and education related to the 
NERR. </P>

<P>Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 
1980</B></U>, as amended, (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 9601 <U>et</U> <U>seq</U>.</P>
<P>Hazardous substances that are toxic to living organisms result from 
industrial processes and are released into the environment either intentionally 
or by accident. CERCLA is designed to respond to these releases and protect 
public health and environmental quality including natural resources. </P>
<P>CERCLA provides for the following two possible actions to protect the public 
and the environment from the harmful effects of a hazardous substance spill. Any 
combination of these two may be used at a particular spill.</P>
<P>1) Response<FONT face=Symbol>¾</FONT> CERCLA authorizes the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) to clean up the spilled substance either at the expense 
of the responsible party or with funds from the Superfund. CERCLA § 104(a)(1). 
Example of steps include: dredging contaminated sediments, repairing leaking 
containers, collecting rain water runoff and relocating displaced residents. 
</P>
<P>2) Damages for natural resource injuries<FONT face=Symbol>¾</FONT> CERCLA 
authorizes the trustees for natural resources, to seek damages from responsible 
parties to restore or replace natural resources injured by exposure to hazardous 
substances. CERCLA </P>
<P>§§ 107(a)(4)(C) and 107(f).</P><U><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Federal Water Pollution Control Act</B></U>, as amended, also called the 
<U><B>Clean Water Act</B></U>, as amended (CWA), 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 <U>et</U> 
<U>seq</U>.</P>
<P>The CWA establishes the basic scheme for restoring and maintaining the 
chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters. The primary 
mechanism in the CWA regulating the discharge of pollutants is the National 
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), which is administered by the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Under the NPDES program, a permit is 
required from EPA or an authorized state for the discharge of any pollutant from 
a point source into the waters of the United States. This includes discharges 
associated with oil and gas development on federal leases beyond state waters. 
An NPDES permit for certain stormwater discharges also is required. Permit 
discharge limits are technology-based and, where technology-based limits would 
not protect desired water quality for a particular water body in which the 
discharge takes place, based on state water quality standards, which are 
developed by the states using EPA guidance and are intended to protect the 
designated uses of the water body. In the case of discharges to the territorial 
sea or beyond, permits are also subject to the ocean discharge criteria 
developed under section 403 of the act. Permits for discharges into the 
territorial sea or internal waters may be issued by states following approval of 
their permit program by EPA; in the absence of an approved state permit program, 
and for discharges beyond the territorial sea, EPA is the permit-issuing 
authority. </P>
<P>The CWA was amended in 1987 to include the current non-point source (NPS) 
program. Under this program (section 319), states must develop management 
programs to address NPS runoff, including the identification of best management 
practices and measures. In addition, section 319 authorizes grants to assist the 
states in implementing their approved management programs. </P>
<P>The CWA generally prohibits discharges of oil and hazardous substances into 
coastal or ocean waters except where permitted under the Protocol of 1978 
Relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from 
Ships. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) investigates and responds to discharges of 
oil and hazardous substances into coastal or ocean waters in accordance with the 
National Contingency Plan (NCP). The USCG, with the cooperation of EPA, 
generally administers the NCP when oil or a hazardous substance is discharged 
into coastal or ocean waters. Regional contingency plans and area contingency 
plans are developed to implement the NCP.</P>
<P>The CWA (section 312) requires vessels with installed toilet facilities and 
operating on the navigable waters of the U.S. to contain operable marine 
sanitation devices certified as meeting standards and regulations promulgated 
under section 312. Section 312 also allows establishment of zones where 
discharge of sewage from vessels is completely prohibited. Amendments made to 
section 312 in 1996 will require, where appropriate, the use of marine pollution 
control devices for operational, non-sewage, discharges from vessels of the 
Armed Forces. </P>
<P>Publicly owned sewage treatment facilities must, at a minimum, meet effluent 
reductions by secondary treatment, except for certain facilities discharging to 
coastal waters for which EPA has approved a waiver under section 301(h).</P>
<P>Section 320 of the CWA establishes the National Estuary Program, which uses a 
consensus-based approach for protecting and restoring estuaries. There are 
currently 28 estuaries in the program.</P>
<P>The Army Corps of Engineers (COE) implements the section 404 permit program. 
Under section 404, a permit is required for the discharge of dredged or fill 
materials into the waters of the U.S. that lie inside of the baseline for the 
territorial seas and fill materials into the territorial seas within three miles 
of shore. Although COE has the permitting responsibility under the section 404 
program except in certain waters of two states (Michigan and New Jersey), which 
have assumed the authority, EPA is authorized to review and comment on the 
impact of proposed dredge and fill activities and to prohibit discharges that 
would have an unacceptable impact on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds 
and fishery areas, wildlife and recreational areas. EPA, in consultation with 
COE, is charged with developing guidelines to be used in evaluating discharges 
subject to section 404. (<U>See</U> 40 C.F.R. Part 230.) The section 404 permit 
requirement is the cornerstone for the current wetlands regulatory program. If 
COE or EPA determines that a certain property is a jurisdictional wetlands, no 
one can discharge dredged or fill materials into it without a section 404 
permit. COE and EPA also have cooperative agreements with the Natural Resources 
Conservation Service and rely on its determinations as to the presence of 
wetlands on agricultural lands. </P><U><B>

<P>Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act</B></U>, 16 U.S.C. §§ 661 <U>et</U> 
<U>seq</U>.</P>
<P>The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act requires that whenever a federal 
agency proposes to impound, divert or otherwise control or modify a body of 
water for any purpose (including issuing permits or licenses), the agency must 
consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries 
Service and the relevant state wildlife resource agency regarding prevention of 
loss or injury to wildlife resources. </P><B><U>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>National Coastal Monitoring Act</U>,</B> as amended, 33 U.S.C. §§ 2801 
<U>et</U> <U>seq</U>.</P>
<P>The National Coastal Monitoring Act, also known as title V of the Marine 
Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, provides joint authority for 
the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration to establish a comprehensive national program for consistent 
monitoring of the nation's coastal ecosystems. The title provides that the 
program is to include, but is not limited to: identification and analysis of the 
status of environmental quality in the nation's coastal ecosystems (including, 
but not limited to, assessment of ambient water quality, benthic environmental 
quality, and health and quality of living resources); identification of sources 
of environmental degradation affecting the nation's coastal ecosystems; 
assessment of the impact of governmental programs and management strategies and 
measures designed to abate or prevent the environmental degradation of the 
nation's coastal ecosystems; assessment of the accumulation of floatables along 
coastal shorelines; analysis of short-term and long-term trends in the 
environmental quality of the nation's coastal ecosystems; and the development 
and implementation of intensive coastal water quality monitoring programs (after 
designation of intensive coastal monitoring areas). </P><U><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>National Contaminated Sediment Assessment and Management Act</B></U>, 33 
U.S.C. § 1271</P>
<P>Section 1271 of the National Contaminated Sediment Assessment and Management 
Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with NOAA and 
the Department of the Army, to conduct a comprehensive national survey of data 
regarding sediment quality and a continuing program to assess such 
quality.</P><U><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>National Environmental Policy Act of 1969</B> <B>(NEPA)</B></U>, 42 U.S.C. §§ 
4321 <U>et</U> <U>seq</U>.</P>
<P>NEPA requires, among other things, that for every major federal action 
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, the agency prepare 
a detailed statement regarding: 
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>(i) the environmental impact of the proposed action;</P>
<P>(ii) any adverse environmental effects that cannot be avoided should the 
proposal be implemented;</P>
<P>(iii) alternatives to the proposed action;</P>
<P>(iv)<B> </B>the relationship between local short-term uses of man's 
environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity; 
and</P>
<P>(v) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources that would be 
involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.</P><B></DIR></DIR></B>
<P>This document is called an environmental impact statement (EIS). It is in 
essence a detailed discussion of the environmental consequences of a given 
proposed agency action, and it must be made available to the agency 
decision-maker on the matter, the public, and other agencies. </P>
<P>Under the regulations implementing NEPA, an environmental document called an 
environmental assessment (EA) is used to determine whether a federal action 
rises to the level of a "major federal action significantly affecting the 
quality of the human environment," thus triggering the requirement of 
preparation of an EIS. Based on the EA, if an action does not rise to that 
level, a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) is made.</P><U><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>National Marine Sanctuaries Act</B></U>, as amended, (also known as Title III 
of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended), 16 
U.S.C. §§ 1431 <U>et</U> <U>seq</U>.</P>
<P>The National Marine Sanctuaries Act, as amended, authorizes the Department of 
Commerce to designate as national marine sanctuaries areas of the marine 
environment of special national significance due to their conservation, 
recreational, ecological, historical, research, educational or aesthetic 
qualities. The Act provides authority for comprehensive and coordinated 
conservation and management of these marine areas. It provides for civil 
penalties for violation of the act or regulations or permits issued under it and 
for civil suits to recover damages if sanctuary resources are injured or 
destroyed. </P><U><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act</B></U>, as 
amended, 16 U.S.C. §§ 4701 <U>et</U> <U>seq</U>.</P>
<P>The Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act, as amended, 
directs the Secretary of the department that houses the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) 
(currently the Department of Transportation) to issue regulations to prevent the 
introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance species into the Great Lakes through 
ballast water. These regulations are to be issued in consultation with the 
Aquatic Nuisance Task Force, composed, <U>inter</U> <U>alia</U>, of the Under 
Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, the Director of the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, 
the Commandant of the USCG and the Assistant Secretary of Army (Civil Works). 
Civil and criminal penalties are available for regulatory violations.</P>
<P>The Act also requires the task force to implement a prevention, monitoring 
and control program for aquatic nuisance species in U.S. waters. States can 
develop comprehensive aquatic nuisance species management plans, which can be 
implemented with federal grants and financial assistance if the plans are 
approved by the task force or the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil 
Works).</P>
<P>The act further requires the Departments of Defense and Transportation to 
implement ballast water management programs for seagoing Department of Defense 
and USCG vessels to minimize risk of introduction of non-indigenous species from 
releases of ballast water. The act also requires the Departments of the Interior 
and Commerce to conduct a ballast water management demonstration program to 
demonstrate preventive technologies and practices. </P><U><B>

<P>Ocean Dumping Act</B></U>, as amended,<B> </B>(ODA) (Titles I and II of the 
Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended), 33 U.S.C. 
§§ 1401 <U>et</U> <U>seq</U>.</P>
<P>The ODA provides the basic authority for the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) and the Corps of Engineers (COE) to regulate ocean dumping (Title I) and 
for the Department of Commerce (DOC), through the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, to carry out research on the effects on ocean 
systems of ocean dumping and other man-induced changes (Title II). </P>
<P>Title I of the ODA: 1) prohibits any person, without a permit, from 
transporting from the U.S. any material for the purpose of dumping it into ocean 
waters (defined to mean those waters of the open seas lying seaward of the 
baseline from which the territorial sea is measured), and 2) in the case of a 
vessel or aircraft registered in the U.S. or flying the U.S. flag or in the case 
of a U.S. agency, prohibits any person, without a permit, from transporting from 
any location any material for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters. Title 
I also prohibits any person, without a permit, from dumping any material 
transported from a location outside the U.S. into the territorial sea, or the 
contiguous zone extending 12 nautical miles seaward from the baseline of the 
territorial sea to the extent that it may affect the territorial sea or the 
territory of the U.S. EPA issues permits regulating the ocean dumping of all 
material except dredged material, which is permitted by COE. COE permits are 
subject to EPA review and concurrence. The specific environmental criteria used 
to evaluate permit applications are developed by EPA; in the case of dredged 
material, this is done in coordination with COE.</P>
<P>In developing criteria for the evaluation of permit applications, the statute 
provides that the following must be considered: 1) the need for the proposed 
dumping; 2) the effect of the dumping on human health and welfare, fisheries 
resources, marine ecosystems, and shorelines; 3) the persistence and permanence 
of the effects of the dumping; 4) the effect of dumping particular volumes and 
concentrations; 5) appropriate locations and methods of disposal or recycling, 
including land-based alternatives; and 6) the effect on alternate uses of the 
oceans. </P>
<P>The ocean dumping of sewage sludge and industrial waste is prohibited. In 
addition, radiological, chemical or biological warfare agents, high-level 
radioactive waste, or medical waste may not be dumped. States may generally 
adopt and enforce requirements for ocean dumping activities that occur in their 
jurisdictional waters. </P>
<P>Title II of the ODA requires<B> </B>the DOC, in coordination with the 
department in which the U.S. Coast Guard is operating and EPA, to conduct a 
comprehensive and continuing program of monitoring and research on the effects 
of dumping of material into ocean or other coastal waters or into the Great 
Lakes. The title further requires the DOC, in close consultation with other 
appropriate departments, to conduct a comprehensive and continuing program of 
research into the possible long-range effects of pollution, overfishing and 
man-induced changes of ocean ecosystems. The title specifies that the program 
must include continuing monitoring programs to assess the health of the marine 
environment, including but not limited to the monitoring of bottom oxygen 
concentration contaminant levels in biota, sediments<B> </B>and the water 
column, diseases in fish and shellfish, and changes in types and abundance of 
indicator species.</P><U><B>

<P>Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA)</B></U>, 33 U.S.C. §§ 2701 <U>et</U> 
<U>seq</U>., <U>inter</U> <U>alia</P></U>
<P>OPA amends section 311 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the Clean 
Water Act or CWA), 33 U.S.C. 1321 <U>et</U> <U>seq</U>., to clarify federal 
response authority, increase penalties for spills, establish U.S. Coast Guard 
response organizations, require tank vessel and facility response plans, and 
provide for contingency planning in designated areas. OPA, however, does not 
preempt states' rights to impose additional liability or other requirements with 
respect to the discharge of oil within a state or to any removal activities in 
connection with such a discharge.</P>
<P>OPA is a comprehensive statute designed to expand oil spill prevention, 
preparedness, and response capabilities of the federal government and industry. 
OPA establishes a new liability regime for oil pollution incidents in the 
aquatic environment and provides the resources necessary for the removal of 
discharged oil. OPA consolidates several existing oil spill response funds into 
the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (Trust Fund), resulting in a $1-billion fund 
to be used to respond to, and provide compensation for damages caused by, 
discharges of oil. In addition, OPA provides new requirements of response 
planning by both government and industry and establishes new construction, 
manning, and licensing requirements for tank vessels. OPA also increases 
penalties for regulatory noncompliance and broadens the response and enforcement 
authorities of the federal government.</P>
<P>Title I of OPA contains liability provisions governing oil spills modeled 
after the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 
(CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 9601 <U>et</U> <U>seq</U>., and section 311 of the CWA. 
Specifically, section 1002(a) of OPA provides that the responsible party for a 
vessel or facility from which oil is discharged, or which poses a substantial 
threat of a discharge, is liable for: 
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>- certain specified damages resulting from the discharged oil; and</P>
<P>- removal costs incurred in a manner consistent with the National Contingency 
Plan.</P></DIR></DIR>
<P>The scope of damages for which there may be liability under section 1002 of 
OPA includes: 
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>- natural resource damages, including the reasonable costs of assessing these 
damages;</P>
<P>- loss of subsistence use of natural resources;</P>
<P>- real or personal property damages;</P>
<P>- net loss of tax and other revenues;</P>
<P>- loss of profits or earning capacity; and</P>
<P>- net cost of additional public services provided during or after removal 
actions.</P>

<P>The RHA prohibits the unauthorized obstruction of navigable waters of the 
United States. The construction of any structure or the excavation or fill in 
the navigable waters of the United States is prohibited without a permit from 
the Army Corps of Engineers. The Act also prohibits the discharge of refuse and 
other substances into navigable waters, but has been largely superseded by the 
Clean Water Act.</P><B><U>

<P>Section 6217 of the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 
1990</U>,</B> 16 U.S.C. § 1455b</P>
<P>Section 6217 of Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990 required 
the 29 coastal states with federally approved coastal zone management plans in 
1990 to develop and submit coastal non-point source (NPS) pollution control 
programs for approval by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The submissions were to 
lay out a state program to restore and protect coastal waters by providing for 
the implementation of management measures developed by EPA. The statute gave 
states 30 months from the date of publication of the final EPA guidance to 
submit a program to NOAA and EPA for approval. The statute required that 
penalties be levied if a state failed to submit an approvable program within the 
allotted time. There has been no need to assess penalties as yet, as all the 
states have submitted programs found to be conditionally approvable. </P><U><B>

<P>Shore Protection Act of 1988</B></U>, 33 U.S.C. §§ 2601 <U>et</U> 
<U>seq</U>.</P>
<P>Under the Shore Protection Act of 1988, municipal or commercial waste cannot 
be transported by a vessel in coastal waters without a permit from the 
Department of Transportation. Municipal or commercial waste includes solid waste 
as defined by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, but excludes waste 
generated by the vessel during normal operations, construction debris, dredged 
or fill material, and sewage sludge. The loading, securing and off loading of 
these wastes must be conducted in a manner to minimize any waste deposited into 
coastal waters.</P>

<P>Title IV of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 
1972</B></U>, as amended, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1447a to 1447f</P>
<P>The purpose of Title IV of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries 
Act of 1972, as amended, is to establish regional research programs, under 
effective Federal oversight, to: 1) set priorities for regional marine and 
coastal research in support of efforts to safeguard the water quality and 
ecosystem health of each region; and 2) carry out such research through grants 
and improved coordination. The regions are: the Gulf of Maine, greater New York 
bight, mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, California, North Pacific, 
Alaska and insular Pacific. </P>
<P>Specifically, a regional marine research board is to be established for each 
region, consisting of eleven members -- three appointed by the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), two by the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA), and six by governors of states located within the region. Each 
board is to develop and submit to NOAA and EPA for approval a comprehensive 
marine research plan for the region, to be updated at least every four years. 
Each board is also to: 1) provide a forum for coordinating research among 
research institutions and agencies, 2) provide for review and comment on its 
research plan by affected users and interests, 3) ensure that the highest 
quality of research projects will be conducted to carry out the plan; and 4) 
prepare, for transmittal to Congress by NOAA and EPA, a periodic report on the 
marine environmental research issues and activities within the region. </P>
<P>Each marine research plan is to include: 1) an overview of the environmental 
quality conditions in the coastal and marine waters of the region and expected 
trends in these conditions; 2) a comprehensive inventory and description of all 
marine research related to water quality and ecosystem health expected to be 
conducted during the four-year term of the plan; 3) a statement and explanation 
of the marine research needs and priorities applicable to the marine and coastal 
waters of the region over the upcoming ten-year period with emphasis on the 
upcoming three-to-five-year period; 4) an assessment of how the plan will 
incorporate existing marine, coastal and estuarine research and management in 
the region; and 5) a general description of marine research and monitoring 
objectives and timetables for achievement through the funding of projects under 
this title so as to meet the priorities specified in the plan in accordance with 
3) above. </P>
<P>Each board may annually submit a grant application to NOAA to fund projects 
aimed at achieving the research priorities set forth in the relevant research 
plan. The title provides that the boards shall cease to exist on October 1, 
1999, unless extended by Congress. Authorization of appropriations for the title 
expired at the end of fiscal year 1996.</P><B>
