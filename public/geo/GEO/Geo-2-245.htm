<H2 align=center>CANADA AND U.S. REACH A COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT UNDER THE 
PACIFIC SALMON TREATY</H2>
<P>OTTAWA</B> -- David Anderson, Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, and Lloyd 
Axworthy, Minister of Foreign Affairs, today announced a comprehensive long-term 
agreement under the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST), signaling a cooperative, 
conservation-based approach to the management of Pacific salmon fisheries, and a 
more equitable sharing of salmon catches between Canada and the United 
States.</P>
<P>"Last year, in Canada, we adopted very tough conservation measures to put 
fish first in our own waters," said Minister Anderson. "This new agreement with 
the United States builds on the same approach. Instead of fighting over a 
shrinking pie, we will now be working together to conserve stocks. It’s a good 
deal because conservation will mean more fish in the future for everyone."</P>
<P>"Today’s agreement represents a real achievement in Canada-US relations, and 
demonstrates that with political will and commitment, it is possible to resolve 
even the most difficult issue for the mutual benefit of both countries," said 
Minister Axworthy.</P>
<P>There are four elements to today’s coast-wide agreement under the Pacific 
Salmon Treaty: 
<UL>
  <LI>Long-term fishing arrangements governing northern boundary fisheries, 
  transboundary rivers, northern boundary coho, southern coho, Fraser River 
  sockeye and pink, chinook salmon coast-wide, and southern chum. These 
  arrangements are all for ten years except for Fraser River sockeye and pink 
  which is a twelve-year arrangement. These arrangements are based on a new, 
  cooperative framework called abundance-based management that is more sensitive 
  to conservation requirements than previous bilateral approaches, and move more 
  fish to Canada for both conservation and harvest; </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Two new Pacific Salmon Treaty Endowment Funds totalling $CDN 209 million 
  ($US 140 million). These funds, one in the North and one for the South, will 
  be administered jointly by both countries and funded by the US Government to 
  invest in habitat, stock enhancement, science and salmon management 
  initiatives in both countries; </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Strengthened institutional arrangements for cooperation among Canadian and 
  US scientists and fisheries managers. This includes elaboration of the rules 
  and procedures for technical dispute resolution, a new bilateral Panel on 
  Transboundary Rivers and the addition of a Committee on Scientific 
  Co-operation to advise the Pacific Salmon Commission; </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>A formal, joint commitment by both nations to protect and restore salmon 
  habitat. </LI></UL>
<P>Pacific salmon stocks have declined precipitously in recent years as a result 
of unpredictable environmental conditions, poor ocean survival, habitat 
degradation and over-fishing. In 1998, in response to declining salmon stocks, 
Canada adopted unprecedented measures to protect Canadian coho. This approach 
included a complete closure of fisheries where stocks were threatened, and the 
announcement of a five-year, $400 million comprehensive program to reduce 
Canada’s commercial fleet, restore and improve habitat and to assist fishermen 
and communities adjust to the changing fishery.</P>
<P>Today’s agreement applies this same precautionary and conservation-based 
approach to fisheries covered under the Pacific Salmon Treaty and reflects the 
objectives established by Canada during the resumption of this year’s efforts to 
reach an agreement. Canada’s objectives were: 
<UL>
  <LI>Long term, coast-wide, conservation-based fishing regimes that put fish 
  first; </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Movement of fish to Canada, reducing US interception of Canada-bound 
  salmon, consistent with the recommendations of David Strangway and William 
  Ruckelshaus; </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Improved co-operation with the US on science and management of Pacific 
  salmon stocks. </LI></UL>
<P>"The Treaty signed in 1985 helped address a number of issues between Canada 
and the United States at a time when most salmon populations were generally in 
good health," said Minister Anderson. "Our challenge in reaching new agreements 
has been to modernize the Treaty so that it addresses today’s reality and 
reflects changed domestic priorities and national interests. These new 
agreements achieve these goals."</P>
<P>"I congratulate the Canadian negotiator Don McRae, the American team, and 
science and fisheries managers from both countries for their hard work in 
reaching an agreement which, in addition to balancing bilateral salmon harvests, 
will provide greater certainty in the management of the Pacific salmon fishery, 
and ensure that the burdens and responsibilities of conservation are shared on 
both sides of the border."</P>
<P>"I would like to express my special thanks to U.S. Secretary of State 
Albright for her personal commitment to make these negotiations a success," said 
Minister Axworthy.</P>
<P>Today’s announcement ends eight years of uncertainty and risks to stock which 
have characterized this issue since the original fishing arrangements expired, 
in 1992.</P>
<P>The agreement also concludes eighteen months of work to implement the 
recommendations of David Strangway and William Ruckelshaus, provided to Prime 
Minister Chrétien and President Clinton in January 1998, on a new approach for 
advancing progress under the Pacific Salmon Treaty. </P>
