start of the last decade, there were just over 10 million mobile cellular 
telephone subscribers around the world. This figure had grown by almost 70 times 
to over 725 million or one mobile phone for every eight inhabitants at the 
beginning of 2001. The mobile phonebook shows little sign of slowing as the 
number of subscribers added grows each year – there were 234million new mobile 
subscribers in the year 2000. Growth has been steady at an average of 50 per 
cent per year since 1996. The introduction of second-generation networks such as 
GSM sparked an increase in mobile growth. Will third generation (3G) networks, 
planned to be launched this year, also push up mobile growth? 
<P>&nbsp;</P>At current growth rates, the number of mobile subscribers will 
surpass that of fixed telephones in the middle of this decade (see Figure 1). 
There are 35 markets – both developed and developing – where this transition has 
already taken place (see Figure2). The mobile phone is becoming away of life for 
many, transcending the limitations of fixed telephones. One phenomenon is that 
fixed household telephone penetration is holding steady or even dropping as 
users opt for mobiles.

<P align=right><IMG align=left alt="" height=246 hspace=15 
src="Geo-2-272_files/fig2.gif" vspace=15 width=358> </P></DIV>In Finland, the 
percentage of households with a fixed telephone has dropped from 94 to 83 over 
the last ten years while that of mobile phones has increased from 7 to 60. In 
developing countries, competition and pre-paid cards are proving a potent 
combination for driving mobile growth. The rise of mobile in developing 
countries is perhaps most powerfully conveyed in the fact that based on current 
growth, China will surpass the United States and emerge as the world's largest 
cellular market sometime this year (see Figure 3). <FONT color=black>Unlike 
fixed telephone penetration, which generally peaks at around one telephone for 
every two inhabitants, mobile penetration has not yet reached an upper limit. 
The highest mobile penetration is found in Taiwan-China (see Figure 3). Ten 
years ago it had less than 100 000 mobile phones; today four out of every five 
Taiwanese has one. Mobile penetration increased by 25 points in 2000 among the 
top ten most wireless economies. At that rate, most adults will soon have at 
least one mobile phone.</FONT>

color=black face="Times New Roman">There are a variety of Internet-like 
applications available for today's mobile phones. The introduction of the second 
generation GSM mobile phone brought a simple but popular application called 
Short Message Service (SMS), which allows text messages to be sent from one 
telephone to another. This e-mail for telephones has proven popular for market 
segments ranging from youngsters to the hard of hearing. According to the GSM 
Association, in the month of January 2001 alone, some 15 billion messages were 
sent around the world, for an average of 30 per GSM subscriber. This is almost 
quadruple the 4 billion sent in January 2000.</FONT><FONT color=black 
face="Times New Roman">The Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), which was 
commercially launched by many operators in 2000,allows mobile phones to browse 
the Internet. Users access websites specially adapted to fit the screen size of 
a mobile phone. By the end of 2000, over 100 mobile operators had launched WAP. 
According to the WAP Forum, there are some 10 000WAP sites in 95 countries. 
Although there are around 50 million WAPphones in circulation, there were less 
than 5 million users at the end of 2000. WAP has been plagued by a number of 
problems including a shortage of handsets, slow speed and a lack of 
applications. The tepid acceptance of WAP contrasts markedly with Japan's mobile 
Internet experience. Japan was the first country in the world to launch mobile 
Internet services when <I>NTTDoCoMo </I>started its <I>i-mode </I>service on 22 
February 2000. In one year, there were five million subscribers. Six months 
later, this number had more than doubled. At the end of March 2001, some 22 
million people were using i-mode. There are two other mobile Internet services 
in Japan, <I>EZWeb </I>and <I>J-Sk</I>y, operated by competitors of NTT 
DoCoMo.The three services had 35 million subscribers between them in March2001, 
with almost 70 per cent of all Japanese Internet surfers logging in from a 
mobile (see Figure 4). Indeed, NTT DoCoMo is now the world's second largest 
Internet Service Provider (ISP), after America Online. One of the attractions of 
i-mode is that, unlike WAP, HTML-based web-sites can be easily adapted. There 
are 1600 sites on NTT DoCoMo'si-mode portal. In addition, there are some 40 000 
i-mode compatible sites. Another i-mode success factor is that it is "always on" 
and priced according to information retrieved and not usage time.</FONT>

face="Times New Roman">The industry is now on the verge of another breakthrough 
to so-called third generation mobile networks. This milestone is significant for 
two reasons. Firstly, it marks the first time that there will be a global 
standard for mobile networks. Up until now, mobile systems have been based on a 
variety of national and regional standards with no less than a dozen different 
ones in operation around the world today. This has had a detrimental effect on 
compatibility and prices. Secondly, the new 3Gnetworks will support broadband 
Internet access.</FONT><FONT color=black face="Times New Roman">The 3G standard 
goes by the ITU name IMT-2000. Adopted by the world telecommunication community 
in November 1999, IMT-2000will support high bandwidth including a minimum speed 
of 144 kbit/sand 2 Mbit/s under low mobility environments. The European Union 
has been an early advocate of 3Gnetworks and called upon its members to rapidly 
license the system and launch networks by a target date of January 2002. Most 
Western European countries awarded licences in 2000 (see Table 2).</FONT><FONT 
color=black face="Times New Roman">In Asia, NTT DoCoMo intended to be the first 
operator in the world to launch 3G services and was granted an IMT-2000 licence 
in June 2000.Although the operator widely publicized plans to be the first to 
start a service in May 2001, it will instead begin with a test launch – 
commercial operation has been postponed until October 2001.</FONT>

style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: SerifaBT-Light">The value of mobile in the 
overall telecommunication market is growing. In the year 2000, mobile revenues 
were USD 273 billion, accounting for almost one-third per cent of the total 
worldwide telecommunication revenues (see Figure 5). On average, a mobile 
cellular subscriber generates revenue of USD 39 per month.</SPAN><FONT size=4>

style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: SerifaBT-Light"></SPAN></FONT><SPAN 
style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: SerifaBT-Light">The launch of IMT-2000 
networks will add to the globalization of the mobile industry. This is because, 
for the first time, there will be a world standard, enhancing roaming and 
interoperability. The industry has continued to witness growing mergers, 
acquisitions and partnerships and these are likely to intensify as operators 
move to create global networks. Two of the top ten national mobile operators in 
2000 are new (Verizon and Cingular) and result from the merger of North American 
cellular companies. Two others, Mannesmann and Omnitel, belong to the Vodafone 
group (see Table 1).Another indicator of the emergence of mobile is that there 
are now more mobile subscribers than personal computers or Internet users in the 
world. With the advent of mobile Internet, will this mean that every mobile 
subscriber will also be an Internet user? This must be what mobile operators are 
gambling on, especially in Europe where USD 105billion has been spent on 
acquiring3G licences (see Table 2).</SPAN><FONT size=4>

style="COLOR: black">The Republic of Singapore – derived from a Sanskrit word 
meaning "Lion City" – consists of a main island 660 km Singapore's census 
counted almost four million inhabitants in June 2000. This diverse country 
includes Chinese (77 per cent), Malay(14 per cent) and Indian (8 per cent) 
ethnic groups. English is widely spoken and is the official language in 
government. Singapore has one of the most advanced telecommunication networks in 
the world with very high levels of access. This has been possible due to the 
small size of the country – essentially a large city –as well as rising levels 
of income. For example, in 1970 Singapore's per capita income was under USD 
1000,ranking it 33rd. By 1998 this figure had risen to almost USD 25 000, making 
Singapore the eighth richest country in the world. The telecommunication market 
has been characterized by progressive liberalization from a State-owned monopoly 
provider to full competition. The incumbent telecommunication operator – 
Singapore Telecommunications Limited (SingTel) – was partly privatized in 
October 1993. The launching &nbsp;of a second mobile cellular operator – Mobile 
One – took place in April 1997. In order to introduce a fixed-line competitor, 
SingTel was compensated for bringing forward the expiry of its fixed monopoly 
from 2007 to 2000. The second fixed and &nbsp;was licensed in 1999. In January 
2000, the government announced that the telecommunication market would be fully 
opened to competition in April 2000. SingTel and StarHub were compensated for 
this change. Practically every household in Singapore has a fixed telephone, 
18.9 percent have a second line and over half have a mobile phone. In July 2000, 
the number of mobile-phone subscribers surpassed that of fixed telephone line 
subscribers. The island's three cellular operators have launched mobile Internet 
services based on the Wireless Application Protocol (WARP). In April 2001, the 
industry regulator – the Infocommunications Development Authority of Singapore 
(IDA) – awarded third generation mobile spectrum to all three incumbent mobile 
operators.&nbsp; </SPAN><FONT size=4>

1999 IDA survey found that 42 percent of Singaporean households had Internet 
access, one of the highest home penetration rates in the world. In December 
2000, there were 1.9 million dial-up Internet subscriptions for a penetration 
rate of 48.3 per cent. This figure includes "free" Internet subscriptions where 
users only pay for telephone usage charges. SingTel has provided each of its 
telephone subscribers with an Internet account so, theoretically, every home 
with a PC and modem has access to the Internet. IDA is actively promoting 
broadband Internet through the nationwide Singapore One backbone. Almost all 
homes are broadband "ready". By the end of 2000, the country had some 70 000 
high-speed ADSL (asynchronous digital subscriber line) and cable modem 
subscriptions and over 250 000 broadband Internet users. Singapore is one of the 
ITU Internet Case Studies. Additional information is available at</FONT><FONT
