<H1>The Gulf War</H1>
<HR>
One of the greatest ecological disasters in history happened when Saddam Hussein 
used oil as a weapon in the Gulf War. The environmental attack came in two 
parts: the <A 
href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/~engenvir//environment/water/oil.gulf.war.html#Water">release 
of oil</A> into the Gulf, and the <A 
href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/~engenvir//environment/water/oil.gulf.war.html#Air">burning 
of Kuwait's oil wells</A>.
<HR>
 
<H3><A name=Water>The Water</A></H3>This prong of the attack was the release of 
a huge amount of oil into the Gulf - estimates range from 0.5 million to 11 
million barrels, and average at about 6 million barrels. Compare this with the 
tremendous consequnces of the <A 
href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/~engenvir//environment/water/oil.exxon.html">Exxon 
Valdez</A> oil spill, which was "only" 230,000 barrels. The oil formed a slick 
30 miles long and 8 miles wide, which is about the same area as the Isle of 
Wight. The slick is thought to have killed between 15,000 and 30,000 birds.
<HR>
The problem was not just the vast amount of oil in the Gulf, but also the nature 
of the Gulf itself. This inland sea is at most only 35m deep, and only has a 
narrow connection to the Indian Ocean through the Straits of Hormuz, which means 
that it takes between three and five and a half years for all the water in the 
Gulf to be changed, so there was no hope of the oil simply dispersing, as it did 
in the <A 
href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/~engenvir//environment/water/oil.braer.html">Braer</A> 
spill. 
<HR>

<H3><A name=Air>The Air</A></H3>Although the burning of Kuwait's oil wells (<A 
href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/~engenvir//environment/water/oil.kuwait.html">picture 
- 192KB</A>) may have been intended as an economic weapon, the environmental 
conseqences were no less severe than those of the oil slick. It is estimated 
that about 67 million tonnes of oil were burned in total, which produced about 
2.1 million tonnes of soot and 2 million tonnes of sulphur, one of the main 
causes of <A 
href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/~engenvir//environment/air/acid.home.html">acid 
rain</A>. Fortunately, the soot particles did not go any higher than 5,000 
metres, which meant that they were washed down with the rain over the next two 
weeks. If the soot had got above the rainclouds, it would have remained up 
there, with severe consequences to the world's climate. As it was, the 
consequences for Kuwait were still harsh. The soot cloud made the daytime almost 
as dark as the night, and the World Health Organisation esimated that death 
rates in Kuwait rose by 10% over the following year because of associated 
breathing difficulties and skin problems.
