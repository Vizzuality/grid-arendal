                  to break apart huge chunks of ice jamming eastern Siberia's 
                  rivers and causing them to flood. Meanwhile, helicopters are 
                  rescuing hundreds of villagers trapped on their rooftops by 
                  the rising waters. The scene is a familiar one in Siberia at 
                  this time of year. However, following the frigid region's 
                  coldest winter on record, this year's springtime floods are 
                  especially harsh.

                        <CENTER>The ice in Lensk blocks river flows and traffic

                        <P></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
                  <P>Every spring, as Siberia gradually begins to warm up from 
                  months of subzero temperatures, frozen rivers thaw. At the 
                  same time, snow that blankets the ground throughout most of 
                  the year begins to melt, feeding the region's rivers. The 
                  result of these two events is annual flooding. 
                  <P>But this winter temperatures hit record lows, plunging to 
                  -50 degrees Celsius (-58 degrees Fahrenheit) in a cold spell 
                  that lingered for weeks. Some rivers froze solid, and are now 
                  taking longer to thaw. As a result, blocks of ice are clogging 
                  the natural flow of water as snowmelt and seasonal rains pour 
                  into the rivers. This year, the snowfall was particularly 
                  severe, exacerbating the current problem. With nowhere to 
                  flow, the rivers are rising over their banks and inundating 
                  villages. 
                  <P>Since May 13, when the disaster began, the floods have left 
                  almost 5,000 homes underwater in 32 towns and villages from 
                  the Volga River in European Russia to the Far East. Officials 
                  estimate that more than 80,000 people are affected. 
                  <P>The worst hit area is Irkutsk Oblast, where nearly 2,000 
                  homes are flooded. Two cities in Irkutsk have been almost 
                  completely evacuated &#8211; Kirensk and Ust-Kut. Kirensk was 
                  completely underwater and Ust-Kut was 80 percent submerged. In 
                  all, some 50,000 people have been evacuated to government-run 
                  shelters. 
                  <P>To prevent further evacuations, the Russian military is 
                  bombing and exploding the ice barricades with dynamite. On 
                  Thursday (May 17), officials prevented the city of Yakutsk 
                  from being inundated when they finally were able to break 
                  apart a 60-mile long sheet of ice that was forcing the Lena 
                  River over its banks. 
                  <P>But even as the icy dams are blown to bits, the floodwaters 
                  keep rising. In Lensk, which has a population of 27,000, 
                  floodwaters had receded on Wednesday (May 16) after officials 
                  dynamited a large block of ice. However, the floodwaters 
                  returned overnight and are expected to continue rising over 
                  the next 48 hours. Russian media reported that water levels in 
                  the town had risen more than 5 meters (16.5 feet) above the 
                  flood stage, and most buildings were submerged. While some 
                  12,000 people have been evacuated by air or boat, another 
                  2,400 remain stranded on rooftops. 
                  <P>Much of the flooding has occurred in rural areas of the 
                  sparsely populated region, making delivery of medical 
                  supplies, food and drinking water difficult. In one case, a 
                  plane delivering relief supplies to Kirensk had to fly 200 
                  miles to another town. From there, officials had to deliver 
                  the goods by truck. 
                  <P>The Russian Red Cross says additional relief supplies are 
                  needed for flood victims. The organization is holding clothing 
                  and food drives, but reported that more food, water 
                  purification filters, medicines, blankets and warm clothes and 
                  footwear are needed.

                  <P>With springtime temperatures still plunging below freezing 
                  at night, warm clothes and blankets are particularly 
                  important, said Ramsey Rayyis, an American Red Cross delegate 
                  in Russia. "It is still extremely cold here," Rayyis said. 
                  "The Russian Red Cross is trying to get to the shelters to 
                  give the people clothes and blankets so they can keep warm." 
                  <P>The American Red Cross has sent 15 tons of food to the 
                  affected area and is donating funds to allow the Russian Red 
                  Cross to purchase warm clothes, footwear, blankets and bed 
                  sheets for flood victims. 
                  <P>As the relief efforts gear up, government officials are 
                  expecting worse. More rain is in the forecast and a fresh 
                  flood wave is forecast to arrive in eastern Siberia from 
                  another tributary of the Lena River. 
                  <P>The last major flooding of the Lena River in Siberia 
                  occurred in 1998, forcing more than 40,000 people to evacuate.
